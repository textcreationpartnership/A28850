            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY doubteſſe will wonder that I, who cannot well endure the very Name even but of a Papiſt in Maſquerade, should yet tranſlate and publish a Book of popery, and this too in a point peradventure of higher concerne then any other now in debate betwen Papiſts and Proteſtants. To give therefore ſome account of my procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding herein, it is to be noted, that the Church of England (if I apprehend her doctrine aright concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:41280:3"/>of the laſt Supper) hath receded from the Tenent of the Church of Rome, not ſo much in the thing received, as in the manner of receiving Chriſts Body and Blood: both Churches agree, that Chriſt our Saviour is truely, really, wholy, yea and ſubſtantially (though not expoſed to our externall ſenſes) preſent in the Sacrament. And thus they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words of Chriſt: <hi>This is my Body which shall be delivered for you. This is my Blood which shall be shedd for the remiſſion of ſins: my Flesh is meat indeed, and my Blood is drink indeed, &amp;c.</hi> Only the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay, This reall preſence is effected by Tranſſubſtantiation of the elements; and Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants ſay, noe; but by ſome other way unintelligible to us. Nor is the adoration of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:41280:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>acknowledged preſent under the formes of bread and wine ſo great a Bugbeare as ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure imagine. For as John Calvin rightly intimates adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a neceſſary ſequel to reall preſence.
<note place="margin">Calvin. de Participat. Corpor. Chr. in Coenâ.</note> 
               <hi>What is more ſtrange</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>then to place him in Bread and yet not to adore him there? And if</hi> JESUS-CHRIST <hi>be in the bread, tis then under the bread he ought to be adored.</hi> Much leſſe is the Oblation of Chriſt when preſent upon the Altar, under the ſymboles, ſuch an incongruity as to render the Breach between Papiſts and Proteſtants (by Proteſtants I mean Church of England men) wholy irreparable; for if Chriſt be really preſent under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated ſpecies upon the Altar, why may he not ſo preſent be offered a gratefull Sacrifice to his heavenly Father, in thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb facs="tcp:41280:4"/>for bleſſings received, in a propitiation for ſin, and in <hi>commemoration of his Death and Paſſion?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the main ſtone of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and Rock of ſcandall in this grand Affaire is Communion under one kinde,
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.8.</note> wherein the Roman Clergy are by ſome heartily blamed for depriving tke Laity of halfe Chriſt, and halfe the Sacrament. For my part I am not for making wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diviſions already too great; nor do I approve of the ſpirit of thoſe who teare Chriſts ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleſſe Garment, by fomenting and augmenting ſchiſmes in the univerſall Church. Indeed I do not finde it any Part or Article of the Proteſtant faith to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve that in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, one halfe of Chriſt is in the bread, and the other halfe in the Wine; but
<pb facs="tcp:41280:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>on the contrary, that in ſome exigences (as of ſickneſſe) a man may receive under one kind or ſpecies, all Chriſt, and an entire Sacrament. So that upon the whole matter the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference herein betweene the Church of England and the Roman, ſeemes to me from the conceſſions of the moſt learned and antient Proteſtants (for I wave the figments of moderne Noveliſts) reducible in great meaſure to mere forme and Ceremony. It is true Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted this Sacrament at his Iaſt Supper under two kinds [which he did as well to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify by a corporeall Analogy to bread and wine, the full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and refreshment this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne food workes in the ſoule; as alſo (ſay the Papiſts) to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sacrifice of his Body and Blood upon the Altar, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly

<pb facs="tcp:41280:6"/>Papiſts on this ſubject, I thought it prudence and juſtice, both to my ſelfe and them, to heare alſo what the Papiſts could ſay in their owne defence: And leaſt I might be impoſed upon by the malice or ignorance of any in a buſineſſe of this high nature, I made choice of an Author, whoſe learning and vertue renders him <hi>omni exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptione major</hi> above the reach of calumny to denigrate, or even criticiſme to finde a blemish in. A perſon who (were he not a Romaniſt) might juſtly be ſtiled the Treaſury of Wiſdome, the Fountaine of Eloquence, the Oracle of his age.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Practiſe of the Church from the Primitive times is, that Communicants recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41280:10"/>under one or both kinds, without ever imagining there wanted any thing to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of Communion, when they received under one alone.</p>
                  <p>It was never ſo much as thought on, that the Grace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Body of our Lord was any other then that which was annexed to his Blood. He gave his Body before he gave his Blood; and it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concluded from the words of S. Lukc, and S. Paul,
<note place="margin">Lukc. 22. v. 20. 1. Cor. 11. v. 24.</note> that he gave his Body during the ſupper, and his Blood after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in ſuch ſort that there was a conſiderable interval bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween the two actions. Did he then ſuſpend the effect, which his body was to produce, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as the Apoſtles had received the Blood? or did they ſo ſoon as they had received the Body at the ſame
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41280:11"/>inſtant receive alſo the Grace which accompanied it, that is to ſay, that of being incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated to Jeſus Chriſt, and nourished by his ſubſtance? Undoubtedly the later. So that the receiving of the Blood is not neceſſary for the Grace of the Sacrament, nor for the ground of the Myſtery: The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is there whol and entiere under one ſole Species; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dos each of the Species, nor both togeather containe other then the ſame ground of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and of Grace.</p>
                  <p>S.
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.27.</note> Paul manifeſtly ſuppoſeth this Doctrine when he writes, that <hi>Hee who eateth this Bread or drinketh the Chalice of our Lord unworthily, is guilty of the Body and Blood of our Lord:</hi> From whence he leaveth us to draw this conſequence, that if in receiving the one or the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41280:11"/>other unworthily wee profane them both, in receiving either of the two worthily wee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the Grace of both.</p>
                  <p>To this there can be no other reply, but by ſaying, as the Proteſtants alſo do, that the disjunctive particle <hi>or</hi> which the Apoſtle makes uſe of in the firſt part of the Text, hath the force of the conjunctive, <hi>and</hi> of which he ſerveth himſelfe in the ſecond. This is the only anſwer M.
<note place="margin">Exam. de l'Euch. V I. Tr. 7.

For though he had made it out, that theſe particles are ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes taken the one for the other, yet here, where S.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41280:12"/>firſt part of his diſcourſe, and reſerving <hi>and</hi> for the ſecond, wee muſt of neceſſity acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that by ſo remarkable a diſtinction he would render us attentive to ſome important truth; and the truth which he would here teach us is, that if after having taken worthily the conſecrated Bread, wee should ſo forgett the Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, afterwards to take the ſacred liquor with a criminall intention, wee should be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not only of the blood of our Lord but alſo of his Body. A truth which can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground then what wee lay dowen (viz) that both the one and the other part of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have the ſame foundation of Grace, in ſuch a manner as that wee cannot profane one without profaning both; nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo receive either of the two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41280:12"/>without partaking of the ſanctity and vertue both of the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>'Tis alſo for this reaſon, that from the beginning of Chriſtianity the faithfull belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that after what manner ſoever they communicated, whether under one or both ſpecies, the Communion had alwayes the ſame efficacy of vertue.</p>

                     <p>I Finde then the cuſtome of receiving under one kind or Species in the Communion of the ſick; in the Communion of infants; in domeſtick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions formerly in practiſe when the Faithfull carryed the Euchariſt home to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in their own houſes; and laſtly (a thing which will much ſurprize our Reformers) in the publick and ſolemne Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Theſe important and deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Points have, I confeſſe, been frequently handled; yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture all the vaine ſubtilities of the Miniſters have not been
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41280:13"/>ſufficiently examined. God by his Grace aſſiſt us to performe this in ſuch a manner that not only antiquity may be illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that truth alſo may be come manifeſt and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</p>
                     <p>The firſt practiſe I inſiſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, is that the ſick were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually communicated under the Species of Bread alone. The Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of wine could not be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo long or ſo eaſily reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, being too ſubject to alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and JESUS CHRIST would not that any thing ſhould appeare to the ſenſe in this myſtery of Faith contrary to the ordinary courſe of nature. It was alſo too ſubject to be ſpilt, eſpecially when it was to be carryed to many perſons in places far diſtant, and with very little conveniency during the times of perſecution. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41280:14"/>Church therefore would at once, both facilitate the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the ſick, and avoid the danger of this effuſion, which was never beheld wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout horror in all ages, as hereafter shall appeare.</p>
                     <p>The example of Serapion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory,
<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. VI. c. 44. edit. Val.</note> makes cleare what was practiſed in regard to the ſick. He was in pennance: but as the law required that the Euchariſt should be given to Penitents when they were in danger of death, Serapion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himſelfe in this ſtate, ſent to demande this holy Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum. <hi>The Prieſt,</hi> who could not carry it himſelfe, <hi>gave to a young man a ſmall parcell of the Euchariſt which he ordered him to Moiſten and ſo convey into the mouth of the old man. The youth being retourned home
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41280:14"/>moiſtned the parcell of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt and at the ſame time infuſed it into the mouth of Serapion, who having by degrees ſwallowed it, preſently gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> Although it appeares by this relation, that the Prieſt ſent only to his penitent that part of the Sacrament which was ſolid, in that he ordained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the young man, whom he ſent, to moiſten it in ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor before he gave it to the ſick perſon, yet the good old man never complained that any thing was wanting: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, having thus communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated he departed in peace: and God who myraculouſly preſerved him untill he had been partaker of this Grace, enfranchiſed him immediately after he had received. S. Denis Bishop of Alexandria, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the third age of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41280:15"/>Church, writ this hiſtory in a letter cited at large by Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius of Caeſaraea, and he writ it to a renowned Bishop, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning this paſſage as a thing then uſuall, by which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative that it was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and authorized, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover ſo holy that God was pleaſed to confirme it by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effect of his Grace.</p>

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that this mixture of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41280:16"/>two ſpecies, ſo expreſsly ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Goſpel, is but a late invention and appeares no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then in the VII. age, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it appeares even then only to be forbidden, as wee shall ſee hereafter; the words of S. Denis Bishop of Alexandria wil not beare the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe gentlemen, ſayng the Prieſt, of whom he there ſpeakes, doth not command to mingle the two ſpecies, but to moiſten that which he gives, that is to ſay without doubt the ſolid part, which having been kept ſeverall dayes for the vſe of the ſick according to the perpetual cuſtome of the Church, ſtood need of being moiſtned in ſome liquor that it might enter the parched thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at of an agonizing man.</p>
                     <p>The ſame reaſon makes the Fathers of the III. Council of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41280:16"/>Carthage, to which S.
<note place="margin">Conc. Carthag. III. c. 76. t. 3. Conc. ult. edit.

And Rufinus, who writ in the time of the III.
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccl. Euſeb. Ruf. init. lib. 6. cap. 34.</note> Council of Carthage, in his tranſlation of Euſebius expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Serapions communion no other wiſe then the Council, ſaying that they cauſed a little of the Euchariſt to be infuſed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41280:17"/>into his mouth: <hi>Parum Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtiae infuſum juſſit ſeni praeberi.</hi> The which demonſtrates the cuſtome of theſe primitive ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and explicates what was meant by this infuſion of the Euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>It is the intereſt of Truth only which obliges me to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this remarke, ſeing in the ſubſtance it imports little to our ſubject, wheather the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or the blood alone were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſick, and that in short it is ſtill to communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te under one ſpecies alone. For as to the diſtribution of the two ſpecies mixed togeather, I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not that any one who is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere (if never ſo little read in antiquity) should imagine it to have beene in uſe in theſe primitive times, during which it appeares not upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that ſo much as the Idea
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41280:17"/>was had of it. The Hiſtory of Serapion makes it ſufficiently appeare, that the conſecrated bread alone was carryed from the Preiſt to the ſick; and that it was in the ſick mans houſe they moiſtned it, to the end he might ſwallow it with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re eaſe; and that they were ſo far from the thought of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling it with the blood, that they mad uſe of another liquor to ſteepe it in a common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor taken at the houſe of the ſick. In fine, this diſtribution of the body and blood mixed togeather begins not to appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re till the VII.
<note place="margin">Conc. Brac. IV. t. 6. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. ult. edit. c. 2.</note> age in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Brague, where it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover forbidden by an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Canon. From whence it is eaſy to comprehend how much a couſtume, which at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares only in the VII. age in a Canon which diſapproves it,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41280:18"/>is short not only of the third age, and the time of S. Denis of Alexandria, but likewiſe of the fourth and that of the third Council of Carthage, (viz) three or four hundred yeares.</p>
                     <p>Wee shall ſee, in another pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, hwo much difficulty was made to admit of the eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this mixture even in the X. and XI. age eſpecially in the Latine Church; and this will ſerve as a new argument to demonſtrate how little it was thought of in the primitive ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and in the III. Council of Carthage: from whence may be undoubtfully gathered that the Communion which was there ordained for the ſick was, without doubt, under one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and moreover, like that of Serapions, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of bread only.</p>
                     <p>Neither will there be any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41280:18"/>difficulty to acknowledge this when we reflect upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how S. Ambroſe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated at his death in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me age. Wee have the life of this Great man writ at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of S. Auguſtin and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him by Paulinus S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſes Deacon and Secretary (whom Eraſmus improperly confounds with the great Saint Paulinus Bishop of Nole) in which he relates that S. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratus the famous Bishop of Verceil, who was come to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt this Saint at his death, <hi>heard this voice three times during the ſilence of the night.</hi> Riſe, ſtay not, he is going to dye. <hi>He went down, preſented him the body of our Lord, and the Saint had no ſooner received it but he gave up the ghoſt.</hi> Who dos not ſee that this great Saint is repreſented to us, as one for whom God
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41280:19"/>took care that he should dye in a ſtate where nothing more could be deſired, ſeeing he had juſt received the body of his Lord? And at the ſame time who would not beleeve, that he had communicated aright in receiving after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Saint Ambroſe did in dying; after the ſame manner that Saint Honoratus gave it; after the ſame manner it was writ to Saint Auguſtin; and after the ſame manner the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Church ſaw it, without fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therein any thing of new or extraordinary.</p>

Oh ſtrange effect of a prejudicate opinion! Wee ſee in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Serapion an aſſured example of one only ſpecies, where the reſtriction of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure Synecdoche cannot have the leaſt admittance, ſeeing Saint Denis of Alexandria expreſſes ſo preciſely, that the bread and ſolid part alone was given. Wee finde the ſame language and the ſame thing in the Council
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41280:20"/>of Carthage, and wee ſee at the ſame time Saint Ambroſes communion, in which there is no mention of any thing but the body. Nay further (for I may well here preſuppoſe what I shall preſently demonſtrate) all ages shew us nothing but the body alone reſerved for the ordinary communion of the ſick: and yet this conſequence muſt not be allowed, and a Synecdoche without aledging one example muſt be preferred to ſo many examples that are received. What blindneſſe, or rather what cavill is this!</p>
                     <p>If theſe Gentlemen would act ſincerely and not ſtudy how to evade rather, then to inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truct, they would ſee that it dos not ſuffiſe to alledge at random the figure Synecdoche, and to ſay that it is ordinary, by the uſe of this figure, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41280:20"/>expreſſe the whole by its part. All things are eluded by theſe meanes, and nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is left in ſpeech. A man muſt come to the matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in particular, and to the place under debate. He muſt examin, for example, weather the figure he would apply to this relation of Paulinus, be found in any other of the like nature, and weather it agree in particular to that of this Hiſtorian. Calixt dos nothing of all this becauſe all this would only have ſerved to confound him.</p>
                     <p>And at the very firſt ſight it is cleare and certain the figure of which he ſpeakes is not one of thoſe which are common in ordinary ſpeech, as when wee ſay to eat togeather, to expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the whole feaſt, and to drink as wel as to eat, or as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews

It is not the cuſtome of Eccleſiaſticall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor in common uſe to name the body alone to expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the body and the blood, ſeing on the contrary we may finde paſſages in every page of the fathers, where the diſtribution of the body and blood is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in expreſſely naming the one and the other; and it may be for certain held that this is the ordinary practice.</p>
                     <p>But without tiring our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves unprofitabley in the ſearch of thoſe paſſages where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may have mentioned the one without the other, nor the particular reaſons which might have obliged them to it; I will ſay (ſticking to the Examples debated of in this place) that I have never ſeen any relation,

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41280:22"/>wee shall alſo treat in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place) has mentioned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the body and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated bread, without naming the blood or the wine, it is <hi>that he expreſses the whole by the part, and that there is nothing more common in books and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in humain language.</hi> But I find not, that in the matter wee treat of, and in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is made of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the Euchariſt, he has found in the Fathers, any more then Calixte, one ſingle example of an expreſſion, which according to him should be ſo common.</p>
                     <p>Behold two Miniſters in the ſame perplexity Calixtes finds the body alone mentioned in the communion of the ſick, and M. du Bourdieu the ſame in domeſtick communion. Wee are not aſtonished at it: wee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41280:22"/>beleeve that the body alone was given in both theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions: Theſe Miniſters will beleeve nothing of it: both of them bring the figure Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche where by to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: both of them are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of Examples in the like caſes: What therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines but to conclude, that their Synecdoche is but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, and that in particular, if Saint Paulinus ſpeake only of the body in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saint Ambroſe, it is in effect that Saint Ambroſe did receive nothing but the body only, according to cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome? If he tell us that this great man expired immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after having received, wee muſt not here ſearch after ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilityes, nor fancy to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves a figure: It is the ſimple truth and matter of fact which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41280:23"/>makes him thus plainly relate what paſſed.</p>
                     <p>But to the end wee may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the conviction of theſe Miniſters, ſuppoſing that their Synecdoche is as common in ſuch like caſes as it is rare or rather unheard of: let us ſe whether it agree with the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in queſtion, and with the Hiſtory of Saint Ambroſe. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus ſayes, <hi>S. Honoratus being gone to repoſe during the ſilence of the night, a voice from heaven advertiſed him that his ſick man was going to expire; that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went down, preſented him with the body of our Lord, and that the Saint give up the Ghoſt preſently after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it.</hi> How comes it to paſs that he did not rather ſay that he dyed immediately after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the pretious blood, if the thing hapned
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41280:23"/>really ſo? Were it as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as Calixtus would have it, to expreſſe only the body, to ſignify the receiving of the body and the blood, by this figure, which puts the part for the whole: it is as naturall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for the ſame reaſon and by the ſame figure, the blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone should be ſometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de uſe of to expreſſe the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under both the one and the other ſpecies. But if ever this should have hapned, it ought to have been cheefly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the occaſion of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saint Ambroſe and of the relation which Paulinus has left us of it. For ſince he would shew the receiving of the Euchariſt ſo immediately fallowed by the death of the Saint, and would repreſent this great man dying as another Moyſes in the embraces of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41280:24"/>Lord; If he intended to abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge his diſcourſe, he should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve done it in abridging and shuning in the relation of that part or action wherein this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bishop terminated his life, that is to ſay in the reception of the blood, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the laſt; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe this ſuppoſed the other, and it would have bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in effect immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, that the Saint rendred up his bleſſed ſoule to God. Nothing would have ſo much ſtruck the ſenſes; nothing would have been ſo ſtrongly printed in the memory; nothing would have preſented it ſelfe ſooner to the thoughts and nothing by conſequence would have run more naturally in diſcourſe. If therefore no mention of the blood be found in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, it is indeed becauſe Saint
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41280:24"/>Ambroſe did not receive it.</p>
                     <p>Calixtus foreſaw verry well,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that the recitate of Paulinus would forme this idea natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the readers mindes, and it is thereupon that he adds, it may verry well be that they carryed to the Saint the pretious blood togeather with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as equally neceſſary, but that Saint Ambroſe had not the time to receave it being prevented by death: Oh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy refuge in a deſperate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe! If Paulinus had this idea; inſtead of repreſenting us his holy Bishop as a man who by a ſpeciall care of the Divine Providence dyed with all the helps which a Chriſtian could wish for, he would on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by ſome word have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted, that notwithſtanding this heavenly advertiſſement, and the extreame diligence of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41280:25"/>S. Honoratus, a ſodain death had deprived this ſick Saint of the blood of his Maſter and of ſo eſſentiall at part of the Sacrament. But they had not theſe Ideas in thoſe times, and the Saints beleeved they gave and received all, in the body only.</p>
                     <p>Thus the two anſwers of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus are equally vaine. In like manner M. du Bourdieu his great follower has not dared to expreſſe eather the one or the other, and in that perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xitay whereinto ſo peciſe teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony had thrown him he endeavours to ſave himſelfe by anſwering only that.

                        <hi>Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe received the communion as he could;</hi> not dreaming that he had immediately before ſaid they had given the two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to Serapion, and that, if it had been the cuſtome, it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41280:25"/>would not have been more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to give them to Saint Ambroſe. Moreover if they had beleived them inſeparable as theſe Miniſters with all thoſe of their religon pretend, it is cleare that they would raither have reſolved to give neither of the two, then to give only one. Thus all the anſwers of theſe Miniſters are turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, and M. du Bourdieu cannot fight againſt us without fighting againſt himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>He has notwithſtanding found another expedient to weaken the authority of this paſſage, and is not afraid, in ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an age as this is, to write that <hi>before this example of Saint Ambroſe there is not any tract to be found of the Communion of the ſick in any words of the anſients.</hi>

<note place="margin">Ibid. 382.</note> For Saint Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, ſayes he, has not expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpecifyed the ſick; as if their ſickneſſe had been a ſufficient cauſe to deprive them of this common conſolation, and not raither a new motive to give it them. But what becomes of the example of Serapion? Is it not clearly enough ſaid that he was ſick, and dying? Tis true: but the reaſon was, becauſe <hi>he was one of thoſe who had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſed to Idols, and one that was ranked amongſt the penitents.</hi> He muſt have been an Idolator to merit to receive the Euchariſt in dying, and the faithfull who during the whole courſe of their lives have never been excluded from the participation of this Sacrament by any crime, muſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41280:26"/>be excluded at their death, when they have the moſt need of ſuch a ſuccour. And thus a man amuſes himſelfe, and thinks he has done a learned exploit when he heaps togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as this Miniſter does, the examples of dyinh perſons whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re there is no mention made of communion; without refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctinh that in theſe deſcriptions wee often omit that which is moſt common, and that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wees hould not have known by this teſtimony of Paulinus that his Bishop had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, if this writer had not intended to shew us the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care which God tooke to procure him this grace.</p>
                     <p>But is this Miniſter ignorant that in theſe occaſions one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſitive teſtimony renverſes the whole fabrik of theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative arguments, which they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41280:27"/>build with ſo much induſtry upon nothing? and is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he should not lee that the example alone of Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe shews us an eſtablished cuſtome, ſeeing that ſo ſoon as Saint Honoratus knew this great man was dying, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, without having need that the Euchariſt should be mentioned to him, that it was time to carry it to this ſick Saint? No matter: The Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would have one to doubt of this cuſtome, to the end they may give ſome reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of ſingularity and novelty to a communion, which was but too clearly given to a Saint, and by a Saint, under one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And what shall wee ſay to Calixtus who ſeems to be aſtonished <hi>that wee dare count Saint Ambroſe amongſt thoſe who communicated under one ſpecies</hi>

                     <p>In a word, we finde in Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus nothing but the common cuſtomes of the Church which every where makes no mention but of the body, when it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that which was kept for the ſick.

It is remarked in this booke that the infirme Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious received the body only, which was given to them ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in unconſecrated wine. There wee finde alſo a cupp in which it was ſteeped, and thus it was the Religious of the moſt famous and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monaſtery in the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated their ſick.

                     <p>The Greeks alſo retained this tradition as well as the Latins; and as their inviolable cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is not to Conſecrate the Euchariſt for the ſick but upon holy Thurſday only, they mixe the ſpecies of bread, wholy dryed during ſo long a time, either with water or unconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated wine. As for conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wine it is manifeſt it could not be kept ſo long eſpecially in thoſe hot countryes, ſo that their cuſtome of conſecrating
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41280:32"/>for the ſick only one day in the yeare, obliged them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them under one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpecies, that is under that of bread which they could kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe without difficulty their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in leavened bread kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping better them ours in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened, eſpecially after the drying wee lately mentioned.</p>
                     <p>It is true (for wee will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble nothing) that at preſent they make a Croſſe with the pretious bloods upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated bread which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the ſick. But beſides that this is not to give the blood of our Lord to drink as it is expreſſed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, nor to marke the ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body and the blood, which alone perſwades our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of the neceſſity of the two ſpecies: It abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that at the yeares end
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41280:33"/>nothing remains of one or two drops of the pretious blood which they put upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bread, and that there is nothing left for the ſick but one only ſpecies. To which wee muſt add, that after all, this cuſtome of the Greeks to mixe a little of the blood with the ſacred Body (concerning which wee ſee nothing in their antient Fathers or Canons) is new amongſt them; and wee shall finde ſome occaſion to make this more clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

They ſpeake like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the box and linnen in which it was kept, and of the care which the Prieſts ought to have to renew the Hoſts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very eight dayes, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate the old ones befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they drunke the holy cup. They ordaine likewiſe how thoſe Hoſts, which had been kept too long, should be burnt, and the ashes reſerved under the Altar, without ſo much as ever ſpeaking, amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obſervances, either of vialls
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41280:34"/>to conſerve the pretious Blood in, or of any precautions for the keeping of it, although it be given us under a ſpecies much more capable of alteration.</p>
                     <p>Wee may aledge alſo upon the ſame account a Canon, which all the Miniſters object againſt us: It is a Canon of the Council of Tours, which wee finde not in the volumes of the Councils,
<note place="margin">Burch. Coll. Can. l. V. c. 9. Yvo dec. II. P. c. 19.</note> but in Burchard and Yvo of Chartres collectors of the Canons of the eleaventh age. This Canon as well, as others ſayes, that <hi>the holy obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is kept for the ſick,</hi> that is the ſpecies of bread as appeares by what followes, <hi>ought to be renewed every eight dayes:</hi> but id adds, which wee finde no where elſe in the Weſt, <hi>that it muſt be dipped in the blood to the end it may be ſaid truly that the body and blood is given.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:41280:34"/>
                     <p>If this Canon gave us any difficulty,
<note place="margin">Aubert. de Euch. lib. II. in Exam. Pii. p. 288.</note> wee might ſay with Aubertin, what is very true, <hi>that Burchard and Yvo of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters collected many things togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without choice or judgement, and that they give us many peices as antient which are not ſuch.</hi> But to act in every thing which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, it may be ſaid, that this Canon ſo exactly tranſcribed by theſe Authors is not falſe, as alſo that it is none of thoſe which were admitted, ſince wee ſee nothing like it in all the others.</p>
                     <p>Moreover this Canon which does not appeare but in above named collections for certain was not made any long time before, and the ſole mixing of the body and blood shews ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently how far short it is of the firſt antiquity. But let it be in what time it will, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41280:35"/>that before it was made it was the cuſtome to name the body and blood even in giving the body only, and this by the naturall union of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and the Grace both of the one and the other. Wee ſee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe that this Council had ſome ſcrupule concerning this matter, and beleeved that in expreſſing the two ſpecies, they ought both of them to be given in ſome manner. In effect, it is true, that in ſome ſence, to be able to call it the body and the blood the two ſpecies muſt be given, becauſe the naturall deſſine of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is to denote that which each of them containes in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Inſtitution. But it will be granted me that to mix them in this manner, and let them dry for eight dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather was but a very weake
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41280:35"/>meanes to conſerve the two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and how ever it be this part of the Canon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a cuſtome ſo particular, cannot be a prejudice to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny decrees, where wee ſee not only nothing reſembling it, but moreover quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>That which is moſt certain is that this Canon makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare they did not beleeve the holy liquor could with eaſe be conſerved in its proper ſpecies, and that their endeavours we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re cheefely to conſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated bread. As to the other part which regards the mixtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, what wee have ſaid too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Grecians may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed here; and all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Miniſters cannot hinder but it will alwayes be certain by this Cannon, that they never beleeved themſelves
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41280:36"/>bound either to make the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon communicating drink, or to give him the blood ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the body, to denote the violent death of our Lord, or laſtly to give him in effect any liquor at all ſeing after eight dayes, it is ſufficiently cleare there remained nothing of the oblation but the drye and ſolid part. So that this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſo much boaſted of by the Miniſters without concluding any thing againſt us, ſerves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew that liberty which the Churches thought them ſelves to have in the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the ſacred ſpecies of the Euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>After all theſe remarks wee have made, it muſt paſſe for conſtant and undeniable, that neither the Greeks nor the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins ever believed, that all that is writt in the Goſpell too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41280:36"/>the communion under two ſpecies, was eſſentiall and expreſſely commanded; and that, on the contrary, it was allwayes believed even from the firſt ages that one ſole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was ſufficient for a true communion ſeing that the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome was to keepe nothing for, nor give nothing to the ſick, but one only.</p>
                     <p>It ſerves for nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that the two ſpecies were frequently carryed to the ſick, and more over in generall that they were carryed to thoſe that were abſent. Saint Juſtin,
<note place="margin">Juſt. Apol. 1.</note> I owne is expreſſe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But why do they alledge to us theſe paſſages which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve for nothing? It is one thing to ſay, as Saint Juſtin does, that the two ſpecies of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were carryed <hi>at the ſame time</hi> (as M. de la Roque ſpeaks)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41280:37"/>
                        <hi>it was celebrated in the Church:</hi>

P. c. 15. p. 176.</note> and another thing, to ſay they could reſerve them ſo long a time as was neceſſary for the ſick, and that it was the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to do ſo, eſpecially in a time when perſecution permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not frequent Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblyes.
<note place="margin">Hier. Ep. IV. ad Ruſt.</note> The ſame thing muſt be ſaid of Saint Exuperius Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Toulouze, of whom Saint Hierome writ, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſold all the rich veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of the Church to redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me captives and ſolace the poor, <hi>he carryed the Body of our Lord in a basket, and the Blood in a veſſell of glaſſe.</hi> He carryed them ſayes S. Hierome, but he does not ſay he kept them, which is our queſtion: And I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that when there was any ſick perſons to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in thoſe circumſtances whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they could commodiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41280:37"/>both the ſpecies without being at all changed, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de no difficulty in it. But it is no leſſe certain, by the common depoſition of ſo many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys, that where as the ſpecies of wine could not be kept with eaſe, the ordinary communion of the ſick, like that of Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion and Saint Ambroſe, was under the ſole ſpecies of bread.</p>
                     <p>In effect,
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Fr. Script. T. IV.</note> wee read in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe of Louis the VI. called the Groſſe, written by Sugerus Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of Saint Denis, that in the laſt ſickneſſe of this Prince the Body and Blood of our Lord was carryed to him, but wee ſee there alſo that this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Hiſtorien thought himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe obliged to render the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, and to advertiſe, <hi>that it was as they came from ſaying Maſſe, and that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it devoutly in proceſſion to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41280:38"/>his chamher:</hi> which ought to make us underſtand in what manner it was uſed out of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe conjunctures.</p>
                     <p>But that which putts the thing out of all doubt is, that in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance M. de la Roque agrees with us as to the matter of fact in debate. There is no more difficulty to communicate the ſick under the ſole ſpecies of bread, then under that of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne only, a practiſe which this curious obſerver shews us in the VII.
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Euch. I. p. ch. 12. p. 150. 160.</note> age in the cleaventh Council of Toledo Canon XI. He ſayes as much of the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent age and of Pope Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis II.
<note place="margin">Conc. Tolet. XI. Paſch. II. Ep. 32. ad Pont.</note> by whom he makes the ſame thing to be permitted for little infants. Hee is ſo far from diſapproving theſe practiſes that he is carefull to defend them, and excuſes them himſelfe <hi>upon an invincible neceſſity,</hi> as if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41280:38"/>a parcel of the ſacred bread could not be ſo ſteeped that a ſick perſon or even an infant might ſwallow it almoſt as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as wine. But the buſineſſe was that he muſt finde ſome excuſe to hinder us from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, from his own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, that the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved she had a full liberty to give one ſpecies only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grety of communion.</p>
                     <p>Behold what wee finde too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the communion of the ſick in the tradition of all ages. If ſome of theſe practiſes which I have obſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that veneration which was payed to the Euchariſt aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onish owr reformers, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare new to them, I engage my ſelfe, to shew them short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in few words, (for it is not difficult) that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41280:39"/>of it is antient in the Church, or reather that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a beginning. But at preſent (that wee may not quit our matter) it is ſufficient for me to shew them, (only by comparing the cuſtomes of the firſt and laſt ages) a continuall Tradition of communicating the ſick ordinarily under the ſole ſpecies of bread; although the Church alwayes tender to her children, if she had belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both the ſpecies neceſſary, would rather have had them conſecrated extraordinarily in the ſick perſons chamber,
<note place="margin">Capit. Any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonis Baſil. Epiſc. temp. Car. Mag. cap. 14. T. VI.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41280:39"/>death the moſt need of their Viaticum.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I do not believe the Gentlemen of the pretended Reformation will raiſe us here any difficultyes upon the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of the ſpecies of which wee shall have occaſion to ſpeake often in this diſcourſe. Thoſe Cavils with which they fill their books upon this point, regard not our queſtion, but that of the reall preſence, from whence alſo, to ſpeake can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, they ought to have been retrenched long ſince; it being cleare, as I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the Son of God who would not in this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry do any myracle, apparent as ſuch to the ſenſes ought not to ſuffer himſelfe to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to diſcover in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture what ever that which he deſigned expreſſely to hide
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41280:40"/>from our ſenſes, nor by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to change what ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily happens to the matter which it has pleaſed him to make uſe of to the end he might leave his body and blood to the faithfull.</p>
                     <p>There is no man of reaſon who with a little reflection, will not of his own accord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the ſame ſentiment, and at the ſame time grant that theſe pretended undecencyes, which are brough againſt us with ſo much ſeeming applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, avail only to moove the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſenſes; but in reality they are too much below the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of JESUS-CHRIST, to hinder the courſe of his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and the deſire he has to unite himſelfe to us in ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular a manner.</p>
                     <p>It happens thus ſo very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in theſe matters (and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41280:40"/>to our Reformers) to paſſe from one queſtion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I eſteeme my ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to keepe them cloſe to our queſtion by this advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſame reaſon obliges me to deſire them not to draw any advantage from the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of bread and wine which will occurre ſo often, becauſe they know, that even in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as wee do, the change of the ſubſtance, it is permitted us to leave the firſt name to thoſe things that are changed, as well as it was to Moyſes to learne that a rod which was turned into a ſerpent,
<note place="margin">Exod. 8.12.</note> or that water which was become blood,
<note place="margin">Ibid. 21.24.</note> or the Angels men becaus they appeared ſuch,

                        <note place="margin">John. 2.9.</note> It is naturall to man, that he may facilitate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41280:41"/>his diſcourſe, to abridge his phraſes, and to ſpeake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the appearances neither is advantage uſvally taken from this manner of ſpeech; and I do not beleeve that any one would object to a Philoſopher, who defends the motion of the Earth, that he overthrows his hypotheſis when he ſayes that the Sun riſes or ſetts.</p>
                     <p>After this ſleight digreſſion to which the deſire of procce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with cleareneſſe has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me, I retourne to my matter, and to thoſe practiſes which I have promiſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate whereby to shew in antiquity the communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one ſpecies.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE ſecond practiſe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove is that when the Communion was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to little children that were baptiſed, it was given them in the firſt ages, yea and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in all the following under the ſpecies of wine only. S.
<note place="margin">Cyp. Tr. de Lapſis.</note> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prien who ſuffered martyrdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in the third age authoriſes this practiſe in his treatiſe <hi>de Lapſis.</hi> This great man repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents there to us with a gravity worthy of himſelfe, what paſſed in the Church and in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to a little girle to whom had been given a little moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread offred to Idols. Her mother who knew nothing of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41280:42"/>it, omitted not to bring her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to cuſtome into the Church aſſembly. But God, who would shew by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſigne how much they were unworthy of the ſociety of the faithfull who had participated of the impure table of Divells, cauſed an extraordinary agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and trouble to appeare in this childe <hi>during prayer: as if,</hi> (ſayes S. Cyprian) <hi>for default of ſpeach she had found her ſelfe forced to declare by this meanes as well as she could, the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune she was fallen into.</hi> This agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which ceaſed not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of prayer, augmented at the approching of the Euchariſt, where JESUS-CHRIST was ſo truly preſent. For, (as S. Cyprian purſues,) <hi>after the accuſtomed ſolemnityes, the Deacon who preſented the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cup to the faithfull being come
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41280:42"/>to the order or ranke of this child,</hi> JESUS-CHRIST who knows how to make himſelfe be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by whom he pleaſes, cauſed this infant at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to feele a terrible impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the preſence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. <hi>She turned away her face,</hi> ſayes Saint Cyprian, <hi>as not able to ſupport ſo great Majeſty; she shuts her mouth, she refuſed the Chalice.</hi> But after they had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de her by force ſwallow ſome drops of the pretious blood, <hi>she could not,</hi> adds this Father, <hi>retaine it in thoſe defiled entrals, ſo great is the power and Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Lord.</hi> It became the body of our Lord to produce no leſſe effects; and Saint Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian who repreſents to us with ſo much care and zeale togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the trouble of this child during all prayer time, not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning this extraordinary emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41280:43"/>cauſed by the Euchariſt, but at the approaching and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the conſecrated Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice without ſpeaking one only word of the body, shews ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently that, in effect, they did not offer her a nourishment that was inconvenient to her age.</p>
                  <p>It is not that they could not, with ſufficient facility, make a childe ſwallow a little of the ſacred bread by ſteeping of it, ſeing it appears even in this hiſtory, that the little girle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here had in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner taken the bread offered to Idols. But this is ſo far from hurting us, that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it lets us ſee how much they were perſuaded that one ſole ſpecies was ſufficient, becauſe there being in deed no impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of giving the body to little infants they ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41280:43"/>to give them the blood alone. It ſuffiſed that the ſollid part was not ſo convenient to that age: and on the other ſide as they would have been obliged to ſteepe the ſacred bread to the end they might make little children ſwallow it; ſo in theſe ages, where wee have ſeen that they did not ſo much as dreame of mixing the two ſpecies, they muſt have been obliged to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke an ordinary liquor before that ſacred liquor the blood of our Lord, contrary to the dignity of ſuch a Sacrament which the Church has alwayes believed <hi>ought to enter into our bodyes before all other nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt. Ep. 118. ad Jan.</note> It was alwayes (I ſay) believed; and not only in the time of Saint Auguſtin,

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41280:44"/>but in the time of Saint Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian himſelfe, as it appeares in his letter to Cecilius,

<note place="margin">Lib. II. ad ux. 5.</note> and in a word before them all becauſe they ſpeake of it as of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished cuſtome. This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which alone was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they gave the blood only to little children though never ſo ſtrong in it ſelfe, would have beene forceleſſe againſt a divine command. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt certainly believed that there was not any divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of uniting the two ſpecies togeather.</p>
                  <p>M.
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Euch. I. p. ch. 12. p. 145.</note> de la Roque would gladly ſay, though he dare not do it in plain tearmes, that they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed the body with the blood
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41280:44"/>for infants, and imagines, <hi>it might be gathered from the words of Saint Cyprian,</hi> though there is not one ſyllable, as wee ſee, which tends to it. But beſides that the diſcipline of that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me did not ſuffer this mixture, Saint Cyprian ſpeakes only of the blood, <hi>It is the blood,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that cannot ſtay in defiled entrals,</hi> and the diſtribution of the ſacred Chalice of which alone this infant had partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, is too clearly expreſſed to leave the leaſt place for that conjecture which M. de la Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que would make. Thus the Example is preciſe: the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of giving the Communion to little children under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of wine only cannot be conteſted, and that doubt which they would raiſe in the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de without any ground, shews only the perplexity they are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41280:45"/>thrown into by the great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Saint Cyprian and the Church in his time.</p>
                  <p>Certainly M.
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Euch. I. p. ch. 11. p. 136. ch. 12. p. 150.</note> de la Roque would have acted with more ſincerity, if he had kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to that Idee which firſt preſented it ſelfe as it were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally unto him. The firſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he had ſpoke of this paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Saint Cyprian, he told us <hi>that they powred by force into the mouth of the child ſome of the ſacred Chalice;</hi> that is without queſtion ſome drops of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood pure and without any mixture, juſt as it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who had already received the body. And on the other ſide wee have even now ſeen that this Miniſter does not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the Pope Paſchalis the II. who, according to him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted little children to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41280:45"/>under the ſole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of wine: ſo much did his conſcience dictate that this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe had no difficulty, in it.</p>

M. du Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu foreſaw verry well this conſequence ſo contrary to his pretentions; and in his ſecond reply he would divine, though Saint Cyprian has ſayd nothing of it, and againſt the whole connection of his diſcourſe, that this little girle when she was ſo cruelly and ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly tormented after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Blood, had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                  <p>But why do wee diſpute any longer? There is no better proofe, nor better interpreter of a cuſtome then the cuſtome it ſelfe, I would ſay, that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is nothing which demonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates more that a cuſtome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes from the firſt ages, then when it is ſeen to continue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively to the laſt.

<note place="margin">Jobius de Verb. incar. lib. III. c. 18. Bibl. Phot. Cod. 222.</note> age in the book of Jobius, where that learned Religious ſpeaking of the three Sacraments which

<note place="margin">Praef. 2. edit. init.</note> thinks he can remove it by two or three very feeble teſtimonyes of moderne Grecians who ſtudyed in England, or who live there, and whoſe writings are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Proteſtant towns.</p>

                  <p>The laſt teſtimony he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is that of an Archbishop of Samos whom wee have too much ſeen in this country, to rely much upon his capacity any more then upon his ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He is at preſent eſtablis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed at London; and M. Smith produces us a letter which he writ to him, wherein he ſayes, that after the baptiſme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the Prieſt <hi>holding the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice where the blood is togeather with the body of our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into little particles, takes in a little ſpoon one drop of this blood ſo mixed, in ſuch ſort that ſome little crums of the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread are found in this ſpoon, which ſuffices to make the child participate of the Body of our Lord.</hi> M. Smith adds that theſe crums are ſo little, <hi>that they cannot well be perceived becauſe of their ſmalneſſe, and that they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41280:49"/>ſtick to the ſpoon though never ſo little dipt into this holy liquor.</hi> See here all can be drawn from a Grecian who is entertained at London, and from M. Smith, in favour of the communion under both ſpecies given in baptiſme to children in the Greeke Church: That is that they gave them the blood in which the body was mixed, with ſo little of deſigne to give them the ſacred body, that they give them <hi>not any part of that which they ſee ſwimme in the holy liquor, and which they give to them of riper yeares,</hi> as M. Smith himſelfe ſayes. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to preſume that <hi>ſome inſenſible particle</hi> of the conſecrated bread ſticks to the ſpoon of the childe: ſee what they call communicating them under both ſpecies. In truth had not M. Smith done as well
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41280:50"/>to change nothing in his booke; and will not every man of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe believe himſelfe obliged to ſtand to that which he ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly in his firſt edition, ſo much the rather becauſe he ſees it conformable to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Tradition which wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve expoſed?</p>
                  <p>And if wee finde the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of little children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſole ſpecies of wine in the Greeke Church, wee finde it no leſſe amongſt the Latins. It is found, according to M. de la Roque in the Decrees of Pope Paſchal II. as wee have lately ſeene, that is to ſay in the eleventh age. It is found till the XII. age in the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church;

For as to the ſubſtance what avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les this controverſy to our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? The antient Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Euchariſt neceſſary for little infants? Wee have all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready demonſtrated that, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the two ſpecies to have been of the eſſence of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that belife would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been a new motive to give
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41280:52"/>it them under both. Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give they it them but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one? and what can theſe Miniſters ſay here, if not to anſwer us, that the antient Church added to the errour of believing that the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, that of beleving the communion to have its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire effect under one ſole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and that by making an antiquity ſo pure to erre, they be willing to shew themſelves viſibly in an error.</p>
                  <p>Wee have, God be prayſed, a doctrine which obliges us not to caſt our ſelves into ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. I could very eaſily expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate how the Grace of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt is in effect neceſſary to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; how the Euchariſt and its grace is virtually contained in Baptiſme; which produces in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41280:52"/>the faithfull that ſacred right which they there receive to the body and Blood of our Lord, and how it belongs to the Church to regulate the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of exerciſing this right. I might alſo shew upon theſe grounds that if ſome one, as for example that William Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Châlons quoted ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by Father Mabillon ſeeme to have beleeved the neceſſity of the Euchariſt, yet this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was ſo far from univerſall, that wee finde it ſtrongly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by other authors of the ſame time,
<note place="margin">Hug. de S. Vict. lib. I, erud. Theol. c. 20. Hiſt. Euch. l. p. ch. 11. p. 139. Fulg. Ep. ad Ferr.

Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin according to S. Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, and shew with them by expreſſe paſſages, and by the whole doctrine of this Father
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41280:53"/>how far he is from that errour they attribute to him. But my deſigne is here to teach what wee ought to believe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the two ſpecies, and not to trouble my ſelfe and my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with theſe incident queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therefore I enter not into them, and without burd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my diſcourſe with an un profitable examen, I shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in few words the fayth of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Church did allwayes and dos ſtill believe that infants are capable to receive the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt as well as Baptiſme, and finds no more obſtacle, as to communion, in theſe words of S. Paul,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe and ſo let him eat,</hi> then she finds, as to Baptiſme, in theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Teach and baptiſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 22.19.</note> But as she knows that the Euchariſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41280:53"/>be abſolutely neceſſary to their ſalvation, after they have received a full remiſſion of their ſins in Baptiſme, she beleeves that it is a matter of diſcipline to give or not to give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at that age.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon for good reaſons she gave it the ſpace of eleaven or twelve hundred yeares, and for other good reaſons she cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give it from that time. But the Church which found her ſelfe free to communicate or not to communicate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, could never have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved she had liberty to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the inſtitution of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS-CHRIST, nor would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have given one only ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, if she had beleeved the two ſpecies inſeparable by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                  <p>In a word, to diſengage our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41280:54"/>ſelves at once from theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable diſputes: when the Church gave the communion to little infants under the ſole ſpecies of wine, she either jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this Sacrament neceſſary to their ſalvation, or she did not. If she did not thinke it neceſſary, why should she preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſo to give it, as to give it wrong? And if she judged it neceſſary, it is a new demonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration that she beleeved the whole effect of the Sacrament included under one ſole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>And further to shew this was her beliefe, the ſame Church which gave the Euchariſt to little children under the ſole ſpecies of wine, gave them it when more advanced in yeares without ſcrupule under the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le ſpecies of bread. None is ignorant of the antient cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41280:54"/>of the Church, to give to innocent children that which remained of the Body of our Lord after the communion of the faithfull. Some Churches burnt theſe ſacred remainders, and ſuch was the cuſtome of the Church of Jeruſalem, as Heſychius Prieſt of that Church relates.
<note place="margin">Heſych. in Levit. lib. II. 68.</note> JESUS-CHRIST is abſolutely above all corruption: but humain ſenſe demanded that, out of reſpect to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that should be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved which leaſt offends the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and it was thought much better to burne theſe ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders, then to ſee them changed by keeping them after a manner leſſe becoming.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41280:55"/>in that age, where their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal grace was entire, as its moſt holy veſſells.
<note place="margin">Evag. lib. IV. c. 35.</note> Evagrius writes in the VI. age that this was the antient cuſtome of the Church of Conſtantinople.

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Evagrius calls theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders <hi>the particles of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Body of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST <hi>our God,</hi> and thus it is that M. de la Roque tranſlates it.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41280:55"/>The ſame Evagrius relates that this communion preſerved a Jewish child, which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in this manner with the children of the faithfull from a burning fournace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into his father had thrown him in hatred of that communion he had received, God being willing to confirme this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under one ſpecies by ſo illuſtrious a miracle. None ever dreamed of ſaying they did amiſſe in giving the body with out the blood, nor that ſuch a communion was defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.

                  <p>In short wee muſt not looke upon this manner of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating at home as an abuſe, under pretence that this practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce was not continued: for in matters of diſcipline only, as this is, the Church has reaſons to forbid at one time, what she permits at another. It is in the time of perſecutions, that is in the moſt holy times, that theſe cuſtomes have been for the moſt part in practiſe, ſo the Communion under one ſpecies is authoriſed by the conſtant practiſe of the beſt of times, and by the exemple of all the Martyrs. It is moreover certain that at this time they communicated oftner under the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41280:59"/>ſole ſpecies of bread, then under both ſpecies, ſeing it was an eſtabliſſed cuſtome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate every day in their houſes under that ſpecies only, whereas they could not receive both ſpecies but in Church aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyes, which Were not ſo frequent; and no body ever ſuſpected, during ſo many ages, that either of theſe wayes of communicating was defective or more imperfect then the other. Thoſe who know, with how much reſpect they treated holy things in theſe dayes, will not finde it an irreverence to put the Communion into the hands of the faithfull, no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then to permit them to carry it to their particular houſes, where it is certain, to our sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that there was more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then there is at preſent in our Churches.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41280:60"/>
                  <p>Wee know likewiſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame care Chriſtians tooke to keepe this pretious depoſitum of the body of our Lord, and above all to hide it from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane hands. Wee ſee in the acts of the Martyrs of Nicomedia that when the Magiſtrates vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the chamber <hi>where S. Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na lived with the Eunuch Indes who ſerved her,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act Mart. Nicom. ap.

They found not the holy Oblation which they had been carefull to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi> It belongs to the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to tell us what theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs did with this Croſſe and this cenſer. Catholicks are not in paine about them, and they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41280:60"/>are over joyd to ſee amongſt the utenſils of theſe Saints, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the ſimplicity of the primitive times, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of their religion, and of the honour they rendred to the Euchariſt. But that which makes for our purpoſe is that wee manifeſtly ſee in this hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory how the Euchariſt was kept, and what care they too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke not to let it fall into the hands of infidels. God himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe aſſiſted ſome times, and the Acts of Saint Tharſicius an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colyte shew that this holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr being <hi>met by Pagans whilſt he carryed the Sacraments of the Body of our Lord, would never diſcover what he carryed, and was killed with ſticks and ſtones; after which theſe infidells ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him they neither found in his hands, nor in his cloaths any parcells of the Sacraments of</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41280:61"/>JESUS-CHRIST, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe having provided for the ſafely of theſe heavenly guifts. Thoſe who are acquainted with the ſtile of theſe times, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it in theſe acts, where it is ſpoke of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of JESUS-CHRIST, and of the Sacraments of his Body. They made uſe of this word Sacrament indifferently either in the plurall or ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number in ſpeaking of the Euchariſt, ſometimes to expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the perfect unity, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metime to make it appeare that there was in one ſole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in one ſole myſtery (for theſe tearmes are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent) yea and in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of this adorable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many Sacraments and many myſteryes together.</p>
                  <p>This keeping of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt under the ſole ſpecies of

                  <p>And though the opinions of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41280:62"/>M. de la Roque were not to be relyed upon, it is ſufficiently cleare that theſe two Councils held in the IV. age or there about, could not have deteſted as a ſacrilege a cuſtom which all the Fathers shew us to have been common in thoſe times, as wee have proved by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement even of the Miniſters themſelves.</p>
                  <p>In fine theſe Councils ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke not of thoſe who receiving in the Church a part of the conſecrated bread reſerve ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part for domeſtick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but of thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the communion from the hands of the Bishop ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low none at all of it. Behold what theſe Councils forbid and it is not difficult to gueſſe at the motives of this their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, ſeeing the I. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Toledo (which in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41280:63"/>XIII. Canon ſo ſeverely bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes thoſe who affected <hi>in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting at the Church never to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate there;)</hi> when it condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the following Canon, <hi>as ſacrilegious perſons thoſe who ſwallow not the communion after they have received it from the hand of the Prieſt,</hi> makes it known ſufficiently by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection that its intention was to condemne another manner of avoiding the communion ſo much the worſe becauſe it shewed either a ſacrilegious hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocricy or too viſible an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this holy myſtery.</p>
                  <p>Theſe unfortunate people who ſo obſtinately avoided the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion were the Priſcillianiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, hereticks of thoſe times and places, who mixed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ordinarily with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But if they will not grant this to have been the motive
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41280:63"/>of that Canon, they cannot at leaſt deny but there are other evill motives not to ſwallow the Euchariſt which might be condemned in theſe Councils. A man may refraine from the Euchariſt out of ſuperſtition, he may reſerve it to abuſe it, he may reject it out of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and the XI. Council of Toledo informes us that it was ſuch a ſacrilege which the firſt condemned. Theſe or the like abuſes taken notice on in certain places might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion to local prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which brought no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the cuſtomes of other countryes: and it is certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover that what is practiſed in one place as well as in one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me with reverence, may be ſo badly practiſed in another time and place, that it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as ſacrilegious. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41280:64"/>in what manner ſoever a man will take theſe Canons, they do not in any ſort autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe the errour, of them who would make the practiſes of the holy Martyrs and of the whole antient Church paſſe for an abuſe, and who can fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de no other anſwer to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible argument but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their proceedings.</p>
                  <p>M. du Bourdieu endeavours to come of by an other evaſion no leſſe impertinent. He would have it be beleeved that the faithfull communicated under both ſpecies in theſe domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick communions and reſerved them both:
<note place="margin">Rep. ch. 18.</note> for which he brings after Calixtus four teſtimonyes,
<note place="margin">Juſt. apol. 2.</note> that of Saint Juſtinus who ſayes that after conſecration in the Church the Deacons carryed the two ſpecies to them that were abſent; That of S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41280:64"/>the great,
<note place="margin">Greg. Dial. III. c. 136.</note> who relates that in a voyage from Rome to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople and in a great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt the faithfull <hi>received the Body and the Blood;</hi> that of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philochius, who tells us in the life of S.
<note place="margin">I. vit.</note> Baſile that a Jew jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe to the faithfull in their aſſembly, carryed away to is houſe <hi>ſome of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Body and Blood;</hi> and laſtly that of Saint Gregory of Nazianzen who relates of his ſiſter Saint Gorgonia that she mixed with her teares what she had gathered <hi>of the ſpecies or ſymboles of the Body and Blood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Naz.</note> he ought to have tranſlated it <hi>of the Body or the Blood,</hi> as it is in the text and not <hi>of the Body and the Blood</hi> as he has done thereby to inſinuate that both the one and the other were reſerved togeather.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe four examples the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41280:65"/>two firſt are manifeſtly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Wee have already remarked with M. de la Roque that in the example of Saint Juſtinus the two ſpecies tis true were carryed, but preſently after they had been conſecrated, by which it dos not appeare that they kept them, which is preciſely our queſtion.</p>
                  <p>To shew that in the paſſage mentioned by Saint Gregory the faithfull had kept the two ſpecies in their veſſelle from Rome to Conſtantinople, it ought before to have been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there was no Prieſt in this veſſelle who could cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, or that Maximian of whom Saint Gregory ſpeakes in this place, was none, though he was the <hi>Superieur of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</hi> This great Pope ſayes nothing of theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41280:65"/>and leaves us the liberty to ſupply them by other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of which the principall is drawn from that impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity already ſo often remarked of keeping ſo little quantity of conſecrated wine ſo long a time.</p>
                  <p>What M. du Bourdieu ſayes here that they durſt not have celebrated in a ship showes that he ſearches only to cavil, without ſo much as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that even at preſent wee celebrate in all ſort of places when there is a reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p>So that of theſe four exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples behold two of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready uſeleſſe. The two others, with the paſſages of Baronius and the learned Aubeſpinus Bishop of Orleans with which they defend them, may verry well prove that the blood was not refuſed to the faithfull to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41280:66"/>carry with them if they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it (for upon what account should they alſo refuſe it, and beleeve that the Sacred Body with which they truſted them was more pretious then the Blood?) but can never prove that they could keepe it any long time, ſince that nature it ſelfe oppoſed it, nor that it was the cuſtome to do it, the Church being ſo well perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the communion was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall under one or both ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that the leaſt difficulty made them determine to give it either in the one or the other kind. Wee ſee alſo in that paſſage of Saint Gregory of Nazianzen that the dos not ſay that his ſiſter watered <hi>the Body and the Blood</hi> with her teares, as if it had been certain she had the one and the other, but <hi>the Body or the Blood,</hi> to shew
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41280:66"/>that he did not know which of the two she had in her kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it being ordinary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the body only.</p>
                  <p>What ſerves it therefore to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as a conſtant practiſe? Truth ought alwayes at the laſt to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to light? And M. de la Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, he who of all the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters has examined this matter with moſt exactneſſe, ingeniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſes <hi>that the faithfull car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed home the bread of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt to take it when they would,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hiſt. Euch. I.

                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:41280:67"/>this which he cals <hi>ſome time,</hi> is as much as to ſay four or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve hundred yeares, and that in the time of the greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and this which he cals <hi>tolerated</hi> is no other then uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received in theſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull ages of the Church, no body ever attempting either to blame them, or to ſay that this communion was unſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                  <p>In the ſequel of his diſpute Calixtus chafes, and labours to prove by the examples al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready refuted, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion might be made under the two ſpecies. But he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes at laſt to the ſolution which he at firſt had given, that the faithfull, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated under the ſole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of bread in their houſes had received the ſpecies of wine in the Church, and that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41280:68"/>there is no example <hi>that they ever communicated publickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one ſpecies for a thouſand or cleaven hundred yeares.</hi> As if it did not ſuffice to convince him that communion under one ſpecies had been declared per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſufficient; or that it was permitted to communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te contrary to the order of JESUS-CHRIST, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide his myſtery in the houſe rather then in the Church; or laſtly that this parcelle of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bread which was taken in private in the houſe was not given at the Church it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and by the hands of the Paſtors for that uſe.</p>
                  <p>Behold the vaine Cavills by which theſe Miniſters think to elude a manifeſt truth: but I will not leave them in their errour as to publick commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and although it ſuffiſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41280:68"/>to have for us this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion taken in private with the approbation of the whole Church, wee shall preſently ſe, that communion under one ſpecies was no leſſe free in ſolemne aſſemblyes then in the houſe.</p>

                  <p>I Place therefore as the fourth practiſe, that in the Church it ſelfe and in the aſſemblyes of Chriſtians it was free for them to receive either both ſpecies or one only. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheans abhorred wine which they beleeved was created by the Devill. The ſame Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans denyed that the ſon of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41280:69"/>God had shed his Blood for our redemption, beleeving that his Paſſion was nothing but an illuſion and a phantaſtical appearence. Theſe two reaſons gave an averſion from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Blood of our Lord which was received in the Myſteryes under the ſpecies of wine: And as, <hi>to hide themſelves the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſayes Saint Leo, and to ſpread more eaſily their venom, <hi>they mixed themſelves with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks even to communicate with them, ſo they received the Body of our Lord only, avoiding to drink the Blood by which wee were redeemed.</hi> This fraudulent proceeding of theirs could hardly be diſcovered becauſe Catholicks themſelves did not all of them communicate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both ſpecies. At the laſt it was taken notice of that theſe Hereticks dit it out of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation:

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41280:70"/>under both ſpecies, and that the thing was indifferently pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed both wayes before: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Manicheans would immediately have too much expoſed themſelves, and could not have expected to be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>But if it had been freely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſay the Miniſters, to communicate under the ſole ſpecies of bread when they would, the Manicheans could not have been diſtinguished by this marke: as if there were no difference betwixt a liberty to receive one or both ſpecies, and a perpetuall affectation of theſe Hereticks obſtinately to refuſe the conſecrated wine.

                  <p>Calixtus had endeavoured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to diſtinguish the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Hereticks mentioned by Saint Leo from this prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by Saint Gelaſius, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to hinder any one from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that the Decree of this laſt Pope in favour of the two ſpecies was to be regarded as in relation to the errors of the Manicheans. What dos this pittifull refuge availe him? Seeing that it appeares clearly by the tearms of this Decree, that it had a particular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, what dos it import us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the Manicheans er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or ſome other ſuch like ſuperſtition?

                  <p>But as to the whole it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted but this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of which Saint Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius ſpeakes here was that of the Manicheans, ſeing that Anaſtaſius the Bibliothecarian ſayes expreſſely in the life of this Pope,

On the other ſide it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that theſe Hereticks had unheard of artifices to inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te themſelves ſecretly amongſt the faithfull, and that there was in their prodigious diſcourſes ſuch an efficacy of errour, that it was a moſt difficult thing to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41280:73"/>efface wholy thoſe impreſſions they left in the minde. None therefore can doubt but that theſe ſuperſtitious people of whom Saint Gelaſius ſpeakes, were the hidden remainders of thoſe Manicheans that Saint Leo his predeceſſor had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thirty or forty yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and whereat Saint Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius has ſaid they are addicted to <hi>I know not what ſuperſtition,</hi> it is not that he did know verry well their errours, but he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes this out of contempt, or rather, becauſe this obſcure ſect changed it ſelfe into a thouſand shapes, ſo that what remained of this poiſon was not alwayes known, or it was not alwayes thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to explicate it to the people.</p>
                  <p>But behold the laſt refuge of theſe Miniſters. They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41280:73"/>wee are in the wrong in ſearching a particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Ordinance of Saint Gelaſius, ſince he eſtablishes it manifeſtly upon the nature of the Myſtery. Let us once more therefore relate the words of this Pope already cited, and let us add thereto their whole conſequence. <hi>Wee have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons take only the ſacred Body, and abſtaine from the ſacred Blood, which perſons truly (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeeme to adhere to I know not what ſuperſtition) let them take both parts or let them be deprived of both, becauſe the diviſion of one and the ſame myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery cannot be done without a great ſacrilege.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To underſtand aright the conſequence of theſe words, wee finde that the diviſion which he accuſes of ſacrilege
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41280:74"/>was that ſame grounded upon the above mentioned ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the Blood of our Lord conſecrated under the ſpecies of wine was regarded as an object of averſion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a deviding of the myſtery to beleeve that there is one part of it which JESUS-CHRIST did not inſtitute, and which ought to be rejected as abominable. But to beleeve that JESUS-CHRIST has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually inſtituted both parts, and not withſtanding to take but one, not out of contempt to the other (God forbid) but becauſe wee beleeve that the vertue of both is received in either, and that in them both there is but one ſole fondation of Grace: if this be to divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the myſtery, the primitive Church dividid it when they communicated the ſick, little
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41280:74"/>children, and generally all the faithfull in their houſes under one ſole ſpecies. But as wee cannot have ſuch an opinion of the antient Church wee muſt of neceſſity avouch that to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide this myſtery ſome thing more muſt be beleeved and practiſed then that which is beleeved and practiſed by all Catholicks.</p>

                  <p>THE antient Church was ſo far from beleeving that to give this Myſtery under one ſole ſpecies was to divide it, that she had certain ſolemne dayes in which she diſtributed nothing but the ſacred Body of our Lord in the Church, and to all the aſſiſtants. Such
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41280:75"/>was the Office of Good Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the Latin Church; and ſuch was the Office of the Greeke Church every day in Lent, except Saturday and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the Latin Church, wee finde in the Ordo Romanus,
<note place="margin">Bib. PP. Var. T. de div. Off.</note> in Alcuinus, or in that antient author whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that booke wee have under his name, in Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius, in Abbot Rupert, in Hugo de Sainto Victore what wee practiſe even to this very day, that they dit not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate upon Good Fryday, but that they reſerved for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion the Body of our Lord conſecrated the day before, and that they received it upon Good Fryday in unconſecrated wine. It is expreſſely remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in all theſe places that the Body only was reſerved without
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41280:75"/>reſerving the Blood, the reaſon of which is (ſayes Hugo de Sainto Victore,)
<note place="margin">Hug. de S. Vict. erud. Theol. l. III. c. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Body and the Blood are received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each ſpecies, and that the ſpecies of wine cannot be kept with ſecurity.</hi> This laſt reaſon wee finde in one of the editions of Amalarius, which is no leſſe his then the others, this Author ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving frequently reviewd his book, ſeverall of which, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed, have been preſerved to our dayes. Such was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the practiſe of Jonas Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Orleans, and of many other Authors; and without troubling our ſelves with theſe criticiſmes, the matter of fact is that Amalarius after divers myſticall reaſons which he brings for this cuſtome accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of other Authors, concludes <hi>that it may be ſaid yet more ſincerely that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41280:76"/>the conſecrated wine is not reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> becauſe it is more ſubject to alteration then the bread. Which confirmes in short all what wee have shown too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the communion of the ſick under the ſole ſpecies of bread, and shews verry vell that the Euchariſt which was conſtantly kept for them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many dayes according to the ſpirit of the Church, could not be kept for them under the ſpecies of wine, ſince they feare even that change which might, happen to it from one day to the next, that is from Thurſday to Good Fryday.</p>
                  <p>I might here take notice that the Church endeavours not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid the corruption of the ſpecies which change the nature, and the neceſſary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sacrament, but alſo every change which makes the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41280:76"/>leaſt alteration in them, being deſirous out of reſpect to this Sacrament, that all there should be pure and propper, and that the leaſt even ſenſible diſrelish should not be ſuffered in a Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery where JESUS-CHRIST was to be the banquet. But theſe remarkes being little ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our ſubject are for another place; and it ſuffiſes us to ſee here, that they reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at that time, as wee do to this verry day do, nothing but the ſacred Body for the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce upon Good Fryday.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe it is certain by all the Authors and by all the paſſages wee have lately quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Prieſt, the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Clergy, and all the people communicated this holy day, and by conſequence commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated under one ſpecies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This cuſtome appeares prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41280:77"/>in the Gallican Church, ſince moſt of theſe Authors we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of it, ſo that it ought to finde a particular veneration amongſt us: but it would be too viſable in abuſing ones ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe to ſay, that a cuſtome ſo firmely eſtablished in the VIII. age had no higher a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Wee finde not the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; wherefore if that opinion, which beleeves communion under one ſpecies to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious, should be admitted, wee muſt ſay that the primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Church had purpoſely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de choyce of Good Fryday, the day of our Bleſſed Saviours death, on which she might profane a Myſtery inſtituted in memory of it. They commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated after the ſame manner upon Eaſter Eve ſeeing that on the one ſide it is certain by all Authors that Good Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41280:77"/>and Eaſter Eve were dayes of communion for all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and on the other ſide it is no leſſe conſtant that they did not Sacrifiſe during theſe two dayes; A thing which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that even at this day wee have no proper Maſſe in our Miſſel for Eaſter Eve. So that they communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſole ſpecies of Bread kept from Holy Thurſday; and if wee will believe our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers they prepared themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves for a Paſchal communion by two ſacrilegious ones.</p>
                  <p>The Monks of Clugny, as holy as they were, did no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then others; and the book of their cuſtoms, once alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cited in this diſcourſe, showes that ſix hundred yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſince, they did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate at that holy time but under one ſole ſpecies.</p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:41280:78"/>
                  <p>Theſe practiſes let us ſee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently the univerſall cuſtome of the Latine Church. But the Greeks go yet further: They do not conſecrate upon faſting dayes to the end they may not mixe the joy and ſolemnity of the Sacrifice with the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of a faſt. From when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it is that in the time of Lent they do not conſecrate but upon Sundayes, and on Saturdayes upon which they faſt not. Upon other dayes they offer the Sacrament reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on thoſe two ſolemne dayes, which they call the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Maſſe, or the Maſſe of the Preſanctified, becauſe the Euchariſt which they offer in theſe dayes had been conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and ſanctifyed in the two precedent dayes, and in the Maſſe they call perfect.</p>
                  <p>The antiquity of this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41280:78"/>cannot be conteſted, being it appeares in the VI. age in the Councile <hi>in Trullo:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Conc. Trull. c. 52.</note> where wee ſee the fondation of it from the IV. age in the Council of Laodicea,
<note place="margin">Conc. Laod. c. 49.91.</note> and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is nothing more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongſt the Greeks then this Maſſe of the Preſanctified.</p>
                  <p>If wee would at preſent know what it is they offerd there, wee have no more to do then to read in their Euchologes and in Bibliotheca Patrum the antient Liturgies of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified;
<note place="margin">Euch. Goat. Bibl. PP. Pariſ. T. II</note> and wee shall there ſee that they reſerved nothing but the ſacred Bread: It is the ſacred Bread which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the Sacriſty, it is the ſacred Bread which they ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, which they adore, and which they incenſe, it is the ſacred Bread which they mix without ſaying any prayer with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41280:79"/>unconſecrated wine and water, and which in fine they diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the people. In ſo much that all the Lent, that moſt holy time of the yeare, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated five dayes of the weeke under the ſole ſpecies of Bread.</p>
                  <p>I know not why ſome of the Latins have undertaken to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me this cuſtome of the Greeks which neither the Popes nor Councils ever reprehended; and on the contrary the Latin Church having followed this cuſtome upon Good Fryday, it is manifeſt that this Office, with the manner of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating practiſed in it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the tradition of both Churches.</p>
                  <p>What is here moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is that though it be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the Greeks recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve not any thing upon theſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41280:79"/>dayes but the Body of our Lord, yet they change nothin in their ordinary formularyes. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred guifts are allwayes named in the plurall, and they ſpeake no leſſe there in their prayers of the Body and the Blood: ſo ſtedfaſtly is it imprinted in the minds of Chriſtians that they cannot receive one of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies without receiving at the ſame time not only the vertue, but the ſubſtance alſo both of the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>It is true the moderne Greeks explane the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves other wayes, and appeare not, for the moſt part, very favourable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under one ſpecies: but it is in this the force of truth appeares the greater, ſince that in deſpite of them, their own cuſtomes, their own Liturgies, their own Traditions pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſentence againſt them.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:41280:80"/>
                  <p>But is it not true will ſome ſay that they put ſome drops of the pretious Blood in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of a Croſſe upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of the ſacred Body which they reſerve for the following dayes, and for the Office of Preſanctified? It is true they do it for the moſt part; but it is true at the ſame time, that this cuſtome is new amongſt them, and that in the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to examin it entirely, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes nothing againſt us.</p>
                  <p>It concludes nothing againſt us, becauſe, beſides that two or three drops of conſecrated wine cannot be preſerved any long time, the Greekes take care, immediately after they have dropped them upon the conſecrated bread, to dry it upon a chafendish and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to powder, for it is in that manner they keep it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41280:80"/>as well for the ſick as for the Office of the Preſanctified: A certain ſigne that the authors of this Tradition had not in proſpect by this mixture the Communion under both ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which they would have given in another manner if they had beleeved them neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but indeed the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome myſtery, ſuch as might be the Reſurrection of our Lord, which all Liturgyes both Greeke and Latin figured by the mixture of the Body and the Blood in the Chalice, becauſe the death of our Lord arriving by the effuſion of his Blood, this mixture of his Body and his Blood is very proper to repreſent how this man-God tooke life again.</p>
                  <p>I should be ashamed to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here all the vaine ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of the modern Greeks, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41280:81"/>the falſe arguments they make about the wine, and about its more groſſe and more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts, which remain after the ſollid bodyes with which wine may be mixed bacome dryed: from whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a like effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the ſpecies of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated wine, and therefore that the Blood of our Lord may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſacred Bread even after it has been upon the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendish, and is entirely drye. By theſe wiſe reaſonings the Lees and the Tartar orſalt would ſtill be wine and a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter for the Euchariſt. Muſt wee thus argued concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the myſteryes of JESUS-CHRIST? It was wine, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called ſo, that is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid and flowing wine which JESUS-CHRIST inſtituted for the matter of his Sacrament.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41280:81"/>It is a liquor which he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to repreſent to our eyes his Blood which was shedd; and the ſimplicity of the Goſpell will not ſuffer the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſubtilityes of the modern Grecians.</p>
                  <p>It muſt alſo be acknowledged they arrived to this but of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry late, and moreover that the cuſtome of putting theſe drops of conſecrated Wine upon the Bread of the Euchariſt was not eſtablished amongſt them but ſince their ſchiſme. The Patriarch Michael Cerularius, who may be called the true author of this ſchiſme, writes notwithſtanding in a booke which he compoſed in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Office of the Preſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, <hi>That the ſacred Breads,</hi>

                     <hi>and this,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is the practiſe of our Church.</hi> So that, let the modern Grecians ſay what they pleaſe, their tradition is expreſsly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this mixture; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own authors, and their own proper tradition the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re remains not ſo much as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe to defend the neceſſity of the two ſpecies in the Preſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified myſteries.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:41280:82"/>
                  <p>For can any one ſo much as conceive what Patriarch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael in the worke by us new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cited ſayes, <hi>That the wine in which they mix the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, is changed into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Blood by this mixing,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as prononcing upon the wine, as appeares by the Euchologes, and by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels own confeſſion, <hi>any one of the myſtick and ſanctifying prayers,</hi> that is to ſay without prononcing the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, bee they what they will (for it is not to our purpoſe to diſpute here of them:) A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious and unheard of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; that a Sacrament can be made without words, contrary to the authority of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and the conſtant tradition of all Churches, which neither the Grecians nor any body elſe ever called in queſtion.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:41280:83"/>
                  <p>By how much therefore wee ought to reverence the antient traditions of the Grecians, which deſcend to them from their fathers, and from thoſe times whilſt they were united to us; by ſo much ought wee to diſpiſe thoſe errours into which they are falne in the following ages, weakned and blinded by ſchiſme. I need not here relate them, becauſe the Proteſtants themſelves do nor deny but that they are great, and I should recede too far from my ſubject: But I will only ſay, to do juſtice to the modern Grecians, that they do not all hold this groſſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Michaels, and that it is not an univerſall opinion amongſt them that the wine is changed into the Blood by this mixture of the Body not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Scripture
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41280:83"/>and Tradition aſſigne a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular benediction by words as well to it as to the Body.</p>
                  <p>Wee are much leſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the Latins who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us but even now the Office of Good Fryday could be fallen into this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſince they explicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves quite contrary in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words; and to the end wee may omit nothing, wee muſt again in few words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their ſentiments.</p>
                  <p>It is true then that wee fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in the Ordo Romanus and in this Office of Good Fryday <hi>that the unconſecrated wine is ſanctifyed by the ſanctifyed bread</hi> which is mixed with it. The ſame is found in the bookes of Alcuinus and Amalarius upon the Divine Office.
<note place="margin">Alc. de Div. Off. Amal. lib. r. de Div. Off. Bib. PP. de Div. Off.</note> But upon the leaſt reflection made of the doctrine they teach in theſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41280:84"/>ſame bookes, it will be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this ſanctification of the unconſecrated Wine by the mixture of the Body of our Lord, cannot be that true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, by which the wine is changed into the Blood; but a ſanctification of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of a much inferiour order: ſuch as that is of which Saint Bernard ſpeakes when he ſayes that <hi>the Wine mixed with the conſecrated Hoſte,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bern. Ep. 69. p. 92.</note> 
                     <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not conſecrated by that ſolemn and particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration which changes it into the Blood of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST, <hi>becomes notwithſtanding ſacred by tooching the ſacred Body of our Lord,</hi> yet of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner from that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration which, according to this Saint, is made by the words taken out of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41280:84"/>
                  <p>That it is of this imperfect and inferiour ſort of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which theſe Authors wee explicate do here ſpeake, will be acknowledged an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth, if wee finde that theſe Authors, and in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes places, ſay there cannot be made a true conſecration of the Blood of our Lord but by words, and by the words even of JESUS-CHRIST him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Alcuinus is expreſſe herein, when explicating the Canon of the Maſſe as wee have it to this day when he comes to the place where wee prononce the ſacramentall words which are thoſe of JESUS-CHRIST himſelfe, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>theſe are the words by which they conſecrated the Bread and the Chalice in the beginning, by which they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41280:85"/>are conſecrated at preſent, and by which they shall be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eternally, becauſe</hi> JESUS-CHRIST <hi>prononcing again his own words by the Prieſts renders his holy Body and his ſacred Blood preſent by a celeſtiall bc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amal. l.

<note place="margin">Lib.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41280:85"/>any words could produce this effect. When therefore they ſay that the pure wine is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by the mixture of the Body of JESUS-CHRIST, it appeares ſufficiently their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that by tooching the Holy of Holyes this wine cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be profane, and beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſome thing of holy: but that it should become the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of JESUS-CHRIST; and that it should be changed into his Blood without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noncing the words of JESUS-CHRIST upon it, is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour inconſiſtent with their doctrine.</p>

                  <p>THUS many conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of the primitive Church, thus many different circumſtances, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in particular and in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, and allwayes with an univerſall approbation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtablished law, that she gave the Communion under one ſpecies, ſo many ages before the Council of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and from the origine of Chriſtianity till the time of this Council, do invincibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that this Council did but follow the Tradition of all ages, when it defined that the Communion under one kind
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41280:89"/>was as good and ſufficient as under both, and that, in which manner ſoever they tooke it, they neither contradicted the inſtitution of JESUS-CHRIST, nor deprived themſelves of the fruict of this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>In matters of this nature the Church has allwayes beleeved she might change her laws ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conjuncture of times and occurrences; and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this account, after having left the Communion under one or both ſpecies as indifferent; after having obliged to both ſpecies for particular reaſons, she has for other reaſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the faithfull to one ſole ſpecies, being ready to give both when the exigence of the Church shall require it, as it appeares by the Decrees of the Council of Trent</p>
                  <p>This Council, after having
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41280:90"/>decided that Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both ſpecies was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<note place="margin">Seſſ. 21. poſt Canon.</note> propoſes to it ſelfe to treat of two points. The firſt, whether it were convenient to grant the Cupp to ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys; and the ſecond upon what conditions it might be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>They had an example of this conceſſion in the Council of Baſile, where the Cupp was granted to the Bohemians, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon condition they should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that JESUS-CHRIST was received wholy and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely under each of the two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and that the reception of both the one and the other was not neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore doubted a long time at Trent whether they should not grant the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me thing to thoſe of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and France who demanded
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41280:90"/>it, in hopes thereby more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to reduce the Lutherans and the Calviniſts. In fine the Council judged it moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, for many important rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to remit the matter to the Pope,
<note place="margin">Seſſ. 22. in fine.</note> to the end he might do herein according as his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence should dictate <hi>what might be the moſt advantagious to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and the moſt convenient for the ſalvation of ſuch as should make this demande.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In conſequence to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample of Paul the III. his ſucceſſour Pius the IV. at the inſtance of the Emperour Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand and ſome other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germany, by his Breifs of the firſt of September 1563. ſent a permiſſion to ſome Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops to render the Cupp to the Germans upon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſet down in theſe Breifs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41280:91"/>conformable to thoſe of Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, if they found it profitable to the ſalvation of ſoules. This was put in execution at Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in Auſtria, and in ſome other places. But it appeared preſently that their mindes we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to much exaſperated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any profit from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The Lutheran Miniſters ſought nothing but an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to cry in the eares of the people, that the Church her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe acknowledged she had been deceived, whilſt she had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that the ſubſtance of the Sacrament was received en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely under one ſole ſpecies: a thing manifeſtly contrary to that declaration she exacted; but paſſion makes prevaricated perſons under take and belec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve any thing.

                  <p>The Church which ought in all things to hold the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance equall, ought neither to make that appeare as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which is eſſentiall, nor that as eſſentiall which is not ſo, and ought not to change her diſcipline but for an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent advantage to all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and it is from this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diſpenſation whence all the changes are come which wee have remarked in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of one or both ſpecies.</p>

John. 3.23.</note> cauſed Saint John to make choice of the borders of Jordan, and amongſt thoſe borders, of the country of <hi>Annon neere to Salim, becauſe there was much water there,</hi> and a great facility to immerge or dipp the men who came to conſecrate themſelves to Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by this holy ceremony.</p>
                  <p>When JESUS-CHRIST ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to Saint John to the end that by receiving Baptiſme he might elevate it to a more wonderfull effect,
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.16. Mark. 1.10.</note> the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſay that he <hi>aſcended out of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41280:94"/>the waters of Jordan</hi> to denote that he had been wholy and entirely immerged, or dipped.</p>
                  <p>It do's not appeare in the Acts of the Apoſtles that the three thouſand, and five thouſand who were converted at the firſt Sermons of Saint Peter were baptiſed after any other manner: and the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe converts is no proofe that they were baptiſed by ſprinkling, as ſome would conjecture. For, beſides that nothing obliges us to affirme they were all baptiſed upon the ſame day, it is certain that Saint John Baptiſt who bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no leſſe then they, ſince all Judea flocked to him, did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding baptiſe them by immerſion or dipping, and his example has showed us that to baptiſe a great nomber of man they were accuſtomed to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41280:94"/>make choice of a place where there was much water: to which wee may further add that the baths and purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the antients, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally thoſe of the Jewes ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred this ceremony facile and familiar in this time.</p>
                  <p>In fine wee read not in the Scriptures of any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of baptiſing, and wee can shew by the acts of Councils, and by antient Rituells that for thirteen hundred yeares the whole Church baptiſed after this manner as much as it was poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The very word alſo which is uſed in the Rituells to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the action of Godfathers and Godmothers when they ſay that they elevate the child from the font of Baptiſme, shows ſufficiently that it was the cuſtome to immerge or
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41280:95"/>dipp them in it. Though theſe truths be without diſpute, yet neither wee nor the pretended Reformers regarde the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts who hold that this immerſion is eſſentiall and no wayes to be diſpenſed with, and neither the one nor the other of us have any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to change this plunging (if I may call it ſo) of the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le body, into a meere ſprinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling or a powring upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me part of the body.</p>
                  <p>No other reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for this change, but that this immerſion or dipping is not eſſentiall to Baptiſme; and the pretended Reformers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing herein, the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple wee have layd muſt be alſo without conteſt.</p>

                  <head>§ II. <hi>Second Principle.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">To know the ſubſtance or eſſence of a Sacrament, wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde the eſſentiall effect.</head>
                  <p>THE ſecond principle is, that to diſtinguish what appertaines or do's not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the ſubſtance of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, wee muſt regard the eſſentiall effect of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Thus, though the words of JESUS-CHRIST, <hi>Baptiſe,</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify <hi>immerge or dipp,</hi> as has beene already ſaid yet it was beleeved that the effect of the Sacrament was not reſtrained to the quantity of the water: ſo that Baptiſme by infuſion and ſprinckling or by immerſion or dipping appearing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41280:96"/>to have the ſame effect, both the one and the other manner is judged vallid.</p>
                  <p>But (as wee have ſaid) no eſſentiall effect of the Body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from that of the Blood can be found in the Euchariſt: ſo that the Grace both of the one and the other in the ground and in ſubſtance can be no other but the ſame.</p>
                  <p>It is nothing to the purpoſe to ſay, that the repreſentation of the death of our Lord is more exactly expreſſed in the two ſpecies; I grant it, in like manner the repreſentation of new birth of the faithfull is more exactly expreſſed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion or dipping, then by meere infuſion or ſprinckling. For the faithfull being dipped or plunged in the water of Baptiſme <hi>is buryed with</hi> JESUS-CHRIST,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.4. Coloſſ. 2.12.</note> according to the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41280:96"/>expreſſion of the Apoſtle; and the ſame faithfull coming out of the waters, comes out of the Grave with his Saviour, and repreſents more perfectly the myſtery of JESUS-CHRIST that regenerated him.</p>
                  <p>Immerſion by which water is applyed to the whole body and to all its parts, do's alſo more perfectly ſignify that a man is fully and entirely waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed from his ſpotts. And yet Baptiſme given by immerſion or plunging is of no more vallue then Baptiſme given by meere infuſion and upon one only part: it ſuffiſes that the expreſſion of the myſtery of JESUS-CHRIST and of the effect of Grace be found in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Sacrament, and that an ultimate exactneſſe of repreſentation is not there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:41280:97"/>
                  <p>Thus, in the Euchariſt, the ſignification of the death of our Lord being found in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance when the Body deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for us in given to us, and an expreſſion of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Sacrament being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo found when under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread the image of our ſpirituall nourishment is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto us, the Blood which dos nothing but add to it a more expreſſe ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not there abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>This is what is manifeſtly proved by the very words of our Lord and the reflection of Saint Paul, when relating theſe words,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.25.26.</note> 
                     <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> he immediately after concludes, <hi>that ſo often as wee eat this Bread and drinke this Cupp wee shew forth the death of our Lord.</hi> Thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41280:97"/>to the interpretation of the Diſciple, the Maſters intention is that when he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines wee should be mindfull of him, wee should be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his death. To the end therefore wee may rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand wheather the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this death conſiſts in the ſole participation of the whole myſtery, or in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of either of its parts, wee need but conſider that our Saviour dos not expect till the whole myſtery be ended and the whole Euchariſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in both its parts, before he ſayes,
<note place="margin">Ibid. 24.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Do this in remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of me.</hi> Saint Paul remarked that at each part he expreſſely ordained this remembrance. For after having ſaid, <hi>Eat, This is my Body, do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me,</hi> in giving the Blood he again repeates, <hi>As
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41280:98"/>often as you shall drinke this, do it in remembrance of me;</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto us by this repetition that wee shew forth his death in the participation of each kinde. From whence it followes that when Saint Paul conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des from theſe words, that <hi>in eating the Body, and drinking the Blood wee shew forth the death of the Lord,</hi> wee muſt underſtand that this death is not only shown forth by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the whole, but alſo by taking either part, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe it is otherwiſe apparent that in this myſticall ſeparation which JESUS-CHRIST has ſignifyed by his words, the Body ſeperated from the Blood, and the Blood ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Body have the ſame effect to shew forth the violent death of our Lord. So that if there be a more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41280:98"/>expreſſion in receiving the whole,
<note place="margin">Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more preſſing.</note> it dos not ceaſe nevertheleſſe to be true, that by the reception of either part his death is wholy and entire repreſented, and the whole Grace applyed to us.</p>
                  <p>But if any here demande, to what purpoſe then was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of both ſpecies, and this more lively repreſention of the death of our Lord which wee have here remarked, it is that they will not reflect of one quality of the Euchariſt, well known to the antients though rejected by our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. All the antients belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Euchariſt was not only a nourishment but alſo a ſacrifice, and that it was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God in conſecrating of it before it was given to the people: which is the cauſe why the table of our Lord, ſo
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41280:99"/>tearmed by Saint Paul in his Epiſtle to the Corinthians,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.21. Heb. 13.10.</note> is called <hi>Altar</hi> by the ſame Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes. It is not our buſineſſe here neither to eſtablish nor explaine this ſacrifice the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which may be ſeene in our Treatiſe of the Expoſition,
<note place="margin">Exp. art. 14.</note> and I shall only ſay, becauſe my ſubject requires it, that JESUS-CHRIST has made this ſacrifice of the Euchariſt to conſiſt in the moſt perfect repreſentation of the ſacrifice on the Croſſe that could be imagined. Whereupon it is that he ſaid expreſſely, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> renewing myſtically by theſe words, as by a ſpirituall ſword, togeather with all the wounds he received in his Body the totall effuſion of his Blood; and although this Body and this
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41280:99"/>Blood once ſeperated ought to be eternally reunited in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to make a perfect man perfectly living, he would notwithſtanding that this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration once made upon the Croſſe should never ceaſe to appeare in the myſtery of the holy table. It is in this myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeperation that he would have the eſſence of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Euchariſt to conſiſt to make it a perfect image or repreſentation of the ſacrifice of the Croſſe: to the end that as this later ſacrifice conſits in the actuall ſeperation of the Body and Blood, this likewiſe which is the perfect image of it should conſiſt alſo in this repreſentative and myſticall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. But whether JESUS-CHRIST has ſeperated his Body and his Blood either real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Croſſe, or myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41280:100"/>upon the Altars, yet can he not ſeperate the vertue, nor effect that any other Grace shall accompany his Blood shed then that ſame in the ground and in ſubſtance which accompanyes his Body immolated: which is the cauſe that this ſo lively and ſo ſtrong a reſemblane or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, neceſſary to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is no more ſo in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Euchariſt, it being every whit as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſeperate in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the effect of his Blood from that of his Body, as it is eaſy and naturall to repreſent to the eyes of the faithfull the actuall ſeperation of the one from the other. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is that wee have found upon ſo many occaſions in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity the Body given without the Blood, and the Blood gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without the Body, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41280:100"/>one of them conſecrated without the other. Our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were perſwaded that the faithfull would be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of ſome thing too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious if the two ſpecies we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not conſecrated in which JESUS-CHRIST had made togeather with the perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of his death the eſſence of the ſacrifice of the Euchariſt to conſiſt; but that nothing eſſentiall was taken from them in giving them but one, becauſe one only contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the vertue of both, and the minde once preoccupayed by the death of our Lord in the conſecration of the two ſpecies, receives nothing from the Altar where they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated which do's not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this figure of death, and the character of a victime: in ſo much that whether wee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41280:101"/>eate, or whether wee drinke, or whether wee do both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, wee allwayes apply the ſame death, and receive allwayes the ſame Grace in ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Neither muſt ſo much ſtreſſe bee put upon the eating and drinking, ſeing that eating and drinking ſpiritually, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the ſame thing, and that both the one and the other is to beleeve. Let it be then that wee eate, or that wee drinke according to the body, wee both eat and drinke togeather according to the ſpirit if wee beleeve, and wee receive the whole effect of the Sacrament.</p>

                  <p>BUT without any further diſpute, I would only aske the Miniſters of the Pretended Reformed Religion whether they do not beleeve, when they have received the bread of the Lords Supper with a firme faith, they have received the Grace which do's fully incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate us to JESUS-CHRIST, and the entire fruict of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſe? What will then the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of wine add there unto, if not a more full expreſſion of the ſame myſtery?</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:41280:102"/>
                  <p>Furthermore, they beleeve they receive not only the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re but the proper ſubſtance of JESUS-CHRIST. Whether it bee by Faith or otherwiſe, is not to our preſent purpoſe. Do they receive it whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, or do they only receive one halfe of it when the Bread of the Lords Supper is given to them? JESUS-CHRIST is he divided? And if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſubſtance of JESUS-CHRIST whole and entire, let them tell us whether the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sacrament can be wanting to them?</p>
                  <p>And it can be no other then this reaſon that as perſuaded them they could give the bread alone to thoſe who could not drinke wine. This is expreſſe in the VII art. of the XII. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their diſcipline, which is that concerning the Supper.</p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:41280:102"/>
                  <p>This argument propoſed at firſt by the great Cardinall Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu intangled very much the Pretended Reformers. I have endeavoured in my Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſolve ſome of the anſwers they give thereto,
<note place="margin">Exp. art. XVII.</note> and I have carefully related what their Synods have regulated in confirmation of that article of their diſcipline. The matter is left without conteſt: thoſe who have writ againſt me have all of them with one accord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it as publick and notorious; but they do not lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe agree in the manner of anſwering it.</p>
                  <p>All were not ſatisfyed with the common anſwer, which only conſiſts in ſaying that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe mentioned in the article of their diſcipline are excuſed from taking the wine by their incapacity of drinking it, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41280:103"/>that it is a particular caſe which muſt not be drawne into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; for on the contrary they ſaw very well that this particular caſe ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by generall principles. If the intention of JESUS-CHRIST were that the two ſpecies should be inſeperable: if the eſſence or ſubſtance of the Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the union of the one and the other: ſince eſſenſes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible, it is not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which theſe receive, it is a meere humaine invention, and has not its foundation in the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>They were forced therefore at laſt, but with extreame pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and after infinite turnings and windings, to ſay that in this caſe he who receives only <hi>the Bread dos not receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST.</p>

                  <p>This is what the Pretended Reformers durſt noſt (that I

Verily a Communion which is not a Sacrament is a ſtrange myſtery; and the Pretended Reformers, who are at laſt obliged to acknowledge it, would do as well to grant the conſequence wee draw from their diſcipline, ſeing they can finde no other way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty this knott, but by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy never heard of in the Church.</p>
                  <p>But the doctrine of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor appeares yet more ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge when conſidered with all its circumſtances.
<note place="margin">Préſervatif, p. 266. 267.</note> According to him, the Church preſents in this caſe <hi>the true Sacrament;</hi> but nevertheleſſe, <hi>what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived is not the true Sacrament,</hi> or raither, <hi>it is not a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as to the ſigne, but it is a true Sacrament as to the thing ſignifyed,</hi> becauſe <hi>the faithfull

                  </p>
                  <p>What do theſe ſubtilityes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile him? He might conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de from his arguments, that the faithfull who cannot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his principles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the true Sacrament of JESUS-CHRIST ſeeing he cannot receive an eſſentiall part, is excuſed by his inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from the obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at all, and that the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he has to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſupplyes the effect. But that upon this account wee
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41280:105"/>should be obliged to ſeperate that which is inſeperable by its inſtitution, and to give a man a Sacrament which he cannot receive, or rather to give him ſolemnly that which being not the true Sacrament of JESUS-CHRIST, can be nothing elſe but meere bread, is to invent a new myſtery in Chriſtian Religion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the face of the Church à Chriſtian who beleeves he receives that which in reality he do's not.</p>
                  <p>Behold nevertheleſſe the laſt refuge of our Reformers: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what he has writ who writ againſt me the laſt of any, whoſe booke is ſo much ſpread by the Proteſtants through France, Holland, and other parts in divers languages, with a magnificent Preface, as the moſt efficacious antidote the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41280:105"/>new Reforme could invent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Expoſition ſo often attaqued. He has found out by his way of improving and refining of others, this new abſurdity, that what is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved amongſt them with ſo much ſolemnity when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drinke wine, is not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of our Lord, and that it is by conſequence a meere invention of humain wilt, which a Church who ſayes she is founded upon the pure word of God, is not afraid to eſtablish without ſo much as finding one ſyllable of it in that word.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, JESUS-CHRIST has not made a particular law for thoſe wee here ſpeake of. Man could not diſpenſe with them in an expreſſe precept of our Lord, nor allow them any thing he did not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41280:106"/>Wherefore either nothing muſt be given them, or if one ſpecies be given them, it muſt be beleeved, that by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our Lord this ſingle ſpecies containes the whole eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sacrament, and that the receiving of the other can add nothing but what is accidentall to it.</p>

                  <p>Let us ſpeake more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: In all practicall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wee muſt alwayes regard, what has been underſtood and practiſed by the Church, and as herein conſiſts the true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the law.</p>
                  <p>I write this for an intelligent and clearſighted Judge, who is ſenſible, that to underſtand an Ordonance, and to diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the meaning of it aright, hee muſt know after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it was alwayes underſtood and practiſed: otherwiſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce every man argues after his owne fashon, the law would become arbitrary. The rule then is to examin how it has been underſtood and how practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41280:107"/>in following which a man shall not be deceived.</p>
                  <p>God to honour his Church, and to oblige particuler perſons to her holy deciſions, would that this rule should have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in his law, as it has in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main lawes; and the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to underſtand this holy law is to conſider in what manner it has alwayes been underſtood and obſerved in the Church.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this is that there appeares in this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and perpetuall practiſe a Tradition which cannot come but from God himſelfe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that what is ſeene alwayes and in all places of the Church cannot come but from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles who learned it from JESUS-CHRIST, and from that Spirit of truth which he has given for a teacher.</p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:41280:107"/>
                  <p>And for feare any one should be deceived by the different ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifications of the word <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I declare that the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I alledge here as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary interpreter of the law of God, is an unwritten doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne procedeng from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and conſerved in the judgement and practiſe of the univerſall Church.</p>
                  <p>I have no neede here to prove this Tradition; and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes will make it appeare that our Reformers are forced to acknowledge it at leaſt in this matter. But it will not be amiſſe to remove in few words the falſe ideas which they ordinarily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this word of Tradition.</p>
                  <p>They tell us that the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which wee give to Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſubjects the Scripture to the thoughts of men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it imperfect.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:41280:108"/>
                  <p>They are palpably deceived. Scripture and Tradition make togeather but one and the ſame body of doctrine revealed by God; and ſo far is it that the obligation of interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by Tradition ſubjects the Scripture to the thoughts of men, that there is nothing can give it more preeminence abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve them.</p>
                  <p>When particular perſons are permitted, as it is amongſt our Pretended Reformers, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own fancy, there is liberty neceſſarily given to arbitrary interpretations, and in effect ſcripture is ſubjected to the thoughts of men, who interpret it each one according to his own mode: but when every one in particular is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to receive it in the ſenſe the Church doth receive and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41280:108"/>alwayes hath received it, there is nothing elevates the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Scripture more, nor ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it more independent of all particular opinions.</p>
                  <p>A man is never more aſſured to underſtand aright the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and ſenſe of the law, then when he underſtands it as it has alwayes been underſtood ſince its firſt eſtablishment. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dos a man honour more the Lawgiver, the minde is never more captivated under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the law, nor more reſtrained to its true ſenſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are particular lights and falſe gloſſes more excluded.</p>
                  <p>Thus when our Fore Fathers in all their Councils, in all their Books, in all their Decrees o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged themſelves by an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable law to underſtand the Holy Scriptures as it has been alwayes underſtood; they were
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41280:109"/>ſo far fom believing that by this meanes they ſubmitted it to humain phancies, that on the contrary they beleeved there was no ſurer meanes to exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de them.</p>
                  <p>The Holy-Ghoſt who dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Scripture, and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited it in the hands of the Church, gave her an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and in all ages: in ſo much that the ſence thereof, which has alwayes appeared in the Church, is as well inſpired as the Scripture it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture is not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect becauſe it has need of ſuch an interpretation. It belonged to the majeſty of Scripture to be conciſe in its words, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found in its ſenſe, and full of a wiſdome which alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo much the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable by how much the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41280:109"/>more it was penetrated into. It was with theſe characters of the divinity that the Holy-Ghoſt was pleaſed to inveſt it. It ought to be meditated on to be underſtood; and that which the Church has alwayes underſtood thereof by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon it, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as a law.</p>
                  <p>So that that which is not writ is no leſſe venerable then that which is, whilſt both of them come by the ſame way. Each one correſponds to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholding of the other, ſeing that Scripture is the neceſſary groundworke of Tradition, and Tradition the infallible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>If I should affirme that the whole Scripture ought to be interpreted after this manner, I should affirme a truth which the Church has alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41280:110"/>but I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the matter in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I reduce my ſelfe to things of practiſe, and principally to what is of ceremony. I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that wee cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish what is eſſentiall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable from what is left to the liberty of the Church, but by examining Tradition and conſtant practiſe.</p>
                  <p>This is what I undertake to prove by Scripture it ſelfe, by all antiquity, and to the end that nothing may be wanting in point of proofe, by the plain confeſſion of our very adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes.</p>
                  <p>Under the name of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I do here comprehend the Sacraments which are in effect facred ſignes and ceremonyes divinely inſtituted to ſignify and confer Grace.</p>
                  <p>Experience shewes that what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41280:110"/>belongs to ceremony cannot be well explained, but by the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved manner of practiſing it.</p>
                  <p>By this our queſtion is deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the ſacred ceremony of the Lords Supper wee have ſeene that the Church has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beleeved she gave the whole ſubſtance and applyed the whole vertue of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in giving only one ſole ſpecies. Behold what has been alwayes practiſed; behold what ought to ſtand for a law.</p>
                  <p>This rule is not rejected by the Pretended Reformers. Wee have even now ſeene that if they had not beleeved that the judgement of the Church and her interpretation ſtand for a law, they would never have divided the ſupper in favour of thoſe who drinke no wine, nor given a deciſion which is not in the Goſpell.</p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:41280:111"/>
                  <p>But it is not in this only that they have followed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of a Church. Wee shall shortly ſee many other points, where they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void having recourſe to this rule wee propoſe.</p>
                  <p>I eſtablish therefore without heſitation this generall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and I advance as the conſtant practiſe, acknowledged by the antient and moderne Jewes, by the Chriſtians in all ages, and by the Pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers themſelves, that the ceremoniall lawes of both the old and new Teſtament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood but by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and that without this meanes it is impoſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the true ſpirit of the law.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE matter is more ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the old Teſtament, where every thing was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced and particulariſed with ſo much care: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is certain that a law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ſo much exactneſſe ſtood in neede of Tradition and the interpretation of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue to be well underſtood.</p>
                  <p>The law of the Sabaoth alone fournisheth many examples of this.</p>
                  <p>Every one knowes how ſtrict was the obſervance of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred reſt,
<note place="margin">Exod. 16.23.35.3.</note> in which it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid under paine of death, to prepare their diet or ſo much as to light their fire. In a word the law forbid ſo preciſely all
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41280:112"/>manner of worke, that many durſt ſcarce move on this holy day. At leaſt it was certain that none could either undertake or continue a journey; and wee know what hapned to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Antiochus Sidetes,
<note place="margin">Joſeph. Ant. 13.16.</note> when this Prince ſtopped his march in favour of John Hyrcanus and the Jewes during two dayes on which their law obliged them to a reſt equall to that of the Sabaoth. In this ſtrict obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to remain in reſt Tradition and cuſtome alone had expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated how far one might go without violating the tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity requiſite during theſe holy dayes. From hence comes that manner of ſpeech mentioned in the Acts of the Apoſtles, from ſuch a place to ſuch a place, <hi>is a Sabaoth dayes journey.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 1.12.</note> This Tradition was eſtablished in the time of our Saviour, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41280:112"/>did he nor his Apoſtles who mentioned it ever repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</p>
                  <p>The exactitude of this reſt did not hinder but that it was permitted to untye a beaſt and lead it to drinke,
<note place="margin">Luk. 13.15.14.5.</note> or to pull it out if fallen into a ditch. Our Lord who alledges theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as publick and notorious to the Jewes, does not only not blame them, but further authoriſes them, though the law had ſaid nothing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, and that theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſeemed to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be imagined that theſe obſervances were of little or no importance in a law ſo ſevere, and where it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take care even to an ïota and the leaſt title, the leaſt prevarication drawing down
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41280:113"/>moſt terrible paines and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable malediction upon the tranſgreſſors.</p>
                  <p>But behold a thing which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares yet more important in the time of the Machabees a queſtion was propoſed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was permitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ones life upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth day;
<note place="margin">1. Mach. 2.32.38.40.41. 2. Mach. 15.1.2. &amp;c.</note> and the Jewes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to be killed, til ſuch times as the Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue had interpreted and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſelfe defence was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, though the law had not excepted that action.</p>
                  <p>In permitting ſelfe defence, they dit not permitt an onſett, what advantage ſoever might thereby arrive to the publick, and the Synagogue durſt never go ſo far.</p>
                  <p>But after the Synagogue had permitted ſelfe defence there remained yet one ſcrupule;
<note place="margin">Joſeph. Ant. 14.8.</note>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:41280:113"/>(viz) whether it were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to repaire a breach upon the Sabaoth. For although it had been decided that they might defend their lives when they were immediately atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, yet they doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that permiſſion extended to thoſe occaſions where the attaque was not ſo immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. The Jewes beſeeged in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem durſt not extend the diſpenſation ſo far, and let themſelves be taken by Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey. The ſcruple appeared a little to nice, and I bring this Example to shew how many caſes might happen in which the law had not provided, and where the declaration of the Synagogue was neceſſary to the quiet of there conſciences.</p>
                  <p>It was an indiſpenſable law to obſerve the new Moons to the end they might celebrate
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41280:114"/>a Feaſt which the law ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preciſely upon that day, and might alſo calculate exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the other dayes which had their particular obſervances. There were no Ephemerides regulated in thoſe firſt times and beſides the Jewes never truſted to any thing of that nature, and not being willing to expoſe themſelves to the errours of calculation, they found no other ſecurity then to cauſe ſome perſons to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains when the Moon should appeare. Neither the manner of obſerving this, nor of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and declaring this to the Council, nor that of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the new Moone, and the beginning of the Feſtivall were expreſſed in the law. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had provided for the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; and the ſame Tradition had
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41280:114"/>decided that what was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in order to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and declaration of the new Moon was not contrary to the law of the Sabaoth.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſpeake of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſes,
<note place="margin">Levit. 2 4.8. Num. 28.9.</note> nor of the other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneyes which were performed upon the Sabaoth day accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law, becauſe the law having regulated them, wee might ſay it had made an exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in this point: but there are many other things which were to be done on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth day in caſes which the law had not regulated.</p>
                  <p>When the Paſſover fell upon the firſt day of the weeke, which is our Sunday, there were divers things to be done for the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Paſchall ſacrifiſe. The victime was to be choſen, it was to be examined by the Prieſts if it had the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41280:115"/>requiſite, it was to be led to the Temple and to the Altar, to be immolated at the hower prefixed. All theſe things with many others we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re done upon the vigil of the Paſſeover. The levained bread was likewiſe to be caſt away, which according to the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe tearmes of the law,
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.15.</note> 
                     <hi>ought not to be found</hi> throughout all Iſrael, when the day of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeover begun. The law might have regulated that theſe things should be done upon the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, when the Paſſeover fel u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Sunday; or otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the obſervance of the Sabaoth to accomplish them. It would not do it: Tradition alone authoriſed the Prieſts to do their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and wee may ſay in theſe caſes, as well as in thoſe which our Bleſſed Saviour has
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41280:115"/>noted,
<note place="margin">Math. 12.5.</note> that <hi>the Prieſts violate the Sabaoth in the Temple, and are without reproach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And do's he not alſo appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve what David did,
<note place="margin">Ibid. 4.</note> when preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with hunger he eat the Bread of propoſition contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the law,
<note place="margin">1. Kings. 21.4.</note> and followed the interpretation of the High Prieſt Achimelec, though it were no where written.</p>
                  <p>The Paſſeover and all the Feaſts of the Iſraelites as well as their Sabaoths begun in the evening and at the time of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres according to the expreſſe diſpoſition of the law: but though the true time of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres be the ſetting of the Sun, yet the Veſpres were not taken ſo preciſely amongſt the Jewes. The law nevertheleſſe had not determined it, and cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone had regulated that Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres or the evening should
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41280:116"/>begin preſently after mid-day, and when the Sun begun to decline.</p>
                  <p>Neither could it alſo be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the preciſe tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the law what was that time <hi>betwixt the two Veſpres,</hi> which is ordained for the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeover in the Hebrew text of Exodus,
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.6.</note> and Tradition alone had explicated that it was all that time which was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended betwixt the declining of the Sun, and its ſetting.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denyed but that all theſe things were of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the law; and if it appeare that the law would not foreſee them, it ought to be concluded that it would leave the explication of them to cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing may be ſaid of divers other ceremonyes,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41280:116"/>which, according to the tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the law, concurred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely at the ſame time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it poſſible to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me them together. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the law ordined an eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſacrifiſe which ought to be offered every day, and this was that they called the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid or the perpetuall ſacrifiſe. There was that of the Sabaoth, and that alſo of the Paſſeover which weere all to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the ſame hour; in ſuch ſort that upon Eaſter day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcript of the law, theſe three ſacrifiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred togeather: There was nevertheleſſe but one only Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar for the Sacrifiſes, and it was neither permitted nor poſſible to offer all theſe ſacrifiſes at the ſame time. Nor did they know how or where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; and in ſo ſtrict an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41280:117"/>as the law exacted in all rigour, they might have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into an unavoidable laba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, if cuſtome had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated that the more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſacrifiſe ought to be offered firſt. So that they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to anticipate the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſacrifiſe to give place to that of the Sabaoth, and that alſo of the Sabaoth to give place to the Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p>If wee ſtick to the preciſe termes of the law of Moyſes,
<note place="margin">Deut. 7.1.2.3.</note> wee finde no mariage with ſtrangers forbidden but only thoſe which were contracted with the daughters of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Nations ſo often deteſted in the Scripture.

<note place="margin">Exod. 21.24.28. Lev. 24.19.20. Dont. 19.21.</note> that ſevere law of Talionis ſo often
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41280:118"/>repeated in the Bookes of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For even to regard theſe tearmes only <hi>eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, bruſe for bruſe, wound for wound,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dos appeare to eſtablish a more perfect and a more juſt compenſation; yet nothing is in reality further from it, if wee weigh the circumſtances, and nothing in fine would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been more unequall then ſuch an equality: nor indeed is it alwayes poſſible to give to a malefactor a wound altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proportionable to that he had given his brother. Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe taught the Jewes that the true deſſigne of the law was to make them ſenſible there ought to be a reaſonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, profitable both to particulars and to the publick, which as it conſiſts not in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe point, nor in a certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41280:119"/>the ſame practiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it by a juſt eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It would not be hard to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge many other Traditions of the antient people as much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of as theſe. The ableſt writers of the new reforme do grand it. When therefore they would deſtroy all unwritten Traditions in generall (under pretenſe of the words of our Lord where he condemnes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Traditions which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the tearmes or to the ſenſe and intent of the law,
<note place="margin">Math. 15.3. Mark. 7.7. &amp;c.</note> and in short thoſe which had not a ſufficiently ſollid foundation) there is no ſincerity in their diſcourſes: and all men of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce will agree that there was lawfull traditions though not written, without which the practiſe it ſelfe of the law was impoſſible; in ſo much that it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:41280:119"/>cannot be denyed but that they obliged in conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Will the Gentlemen of the Pretended Reformed Religion permit me to mention in this place the Tradition of prayer for the dead? This prayer is manifeſt by the Book of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees:
<note place="margin">2. Mach. 11.43.46.</note> neither neede wee here enter into diſpute with theſe Gentlemen whether this Booke be canonicall or no, ſeeing it ſuffices as to this point that it was certainly writ befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the Goſpell. This cuſtome remaines to this day amongſt the Jewes, and the tradition of it my be aſſerted by theſe words of Saint Paul:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.29.</note> 
                     <hi>What shall they do elſe who are baptiſed,</hi> that is to ſay purifyed and mortifyed <hi>for the dead, if the dead riſe not at all?</hi> JESUS-CHRIST and his Apoſtles had found amongſt the Jewes this Tradition of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41280:120"/>praying for the dead without reprehending them for it; on the contrary it paſſed immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely from the Judaicall to the Chriſtian Church, and Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants who have writ bookes where they shew this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was eſtabliſed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times of Chriſtianity, could yet never shew the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is certain there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it in the law. It came to the Jewes by the ſame way which handed to them ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other unviolable Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>But if a law which deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to ſo minute particulars, and which is (as I may ſay) wholy literall, ſtood in need, that it might be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to its true ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, of being interpreted by the practiſe and declarations of the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41280:120"/>Synagogue, how much more need have wee in the law of the Goſpell where there is a greater liberty in the obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and where the practiſes are leſſe circumſtanced.</p>
                  <p>A hundred examples will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the truth of what I ſay.

                  <p>THE inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth day preceded the law of Moyſes and had its ground from the creation; and nevertheleſſe theſe Gentlemen diſpenſe as well as wee with that obſervance without any other foundation then that of Tradition and the practiſe of the Church, which cannot be dirived from other then divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne authority.</p>
                  <p>The allegation that the firſt day of the weeke conſecrated by the Reſurrection of JESUS-CHRIST,
<note place="margin">Act. 20.7. 1. Cor. 16.2.</note> is mentioned in the writings of the Apoſtles as a day of aſſembly for Chriſtians, and that it is alſo called in the Revelations,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                     <hi>the day of the Lord,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41280:121"/>or Sunday.</hi> Is vaine for beſides that there is no mention made in the New Teſtament of that reſt annexed to the Sunday, it is moreover manifeſt that the addition of a new day dit not ſuffiſe to take away the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the old, nor to make us change the Preceps of the Decalogue togeather with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Tradition.</p>
                  <p>The prohibition of eating Blood, and that of eating the flesh of ſtrangled creatures was given to all the children of Noe before the eſtablishment of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal obſervances, from which wee are freed by the Goſpel, and the Apoſtles have confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it in the Council of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem in joyning it to two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable obſervances, of which the one is the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to participate of ſacrifices to Idols, and the other the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41280:122"/>of the ſin of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But becauſe the Church alwayes beleeved that this law though obſerved during many ages was not eſſentiall to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, the Pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers as well as we diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce with themſelves about it, though the Scriptures have no where derogated from ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſo ſolemne a deciſion of the Apoſtles expreſſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in their Acts by Saint Luke.</p>
                  <p>But to shew how neceſſary it is to know the Tradition and practiſe of the Church in what regards the Sacraments, let us conſider what is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Sacrament of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and that of the Euchariſt, which are the two Sacraments our adverſaryes acknowledge with one accord.</p>
                  <p>It is to the Apoſtles, that is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41280:122"/>to the heads of the flock,
<note place="margin">Math. 28.19.</note> that JESUS-CHRIST gave the charge of adminiſtring Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me:
<note place="margin">Tertull. de Bapt. Concil. Illid. c. 38. &amp;c.</note> notwithſtanding the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Church has underſtood, not only that Prieſts, but Deacons alſo yea even all the faithfull, in caſes of neceſſity, were the Miniſters of this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Tradition alone has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted that Baptiſme (which JESUS-CHRIST committed only into the hands of his Church and of his Apoſtles) could be validly adminiſtred by Hereticks, and out of the communion of the truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>In the XI. chapter of the Diſcipline of the Pretended Reformers, and firſt article, it is ſaid that <hi>Baptiſme adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by him who has no vocation at all is wholy nul;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diſcip. c. XI. art. 1. &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv.</note> and the obſervations drawn from the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41280:123"/>Synods declare, that to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of this Sacrament it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that theſe Miniſters have <hi>an outwardly ſeeming vocation,</hi> ſuch as is that of Curates, Prieſts, and Religious men in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church who are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preach. Where do they finde in Scripture that this <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſeeming vocation</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a power which JESUS-CHRIST has given only to thoſe whom he himſelfe did effectively call.</p>
                  <p>JESUS-CHRIST ſaid, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize,</hi> that is immerge or dipp, as wee have often remarked. Wee have alſo related that he was baptized according to this forme; that the Apoſtles fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, and that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church till the XII and XIII. ages; and notwithſtanding Baptiſme by infuſion or ſprincling is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41280:123"/>without difficulty by the ſole authority of the Church.</p>
                  <p>JESUS-CHRIST ſaid,
<note place="margin">Math. 28.19. Mark. 16.15.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Teach and baptize;</hi> and again, <hi>He that beleeveth and is baptized, shall be ſaved.</hi> The Church has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the ſole authority of Tradition and practiſe that the inſtruction and faith which JESUS-CHRIST had united to Baptiſme, might be ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in order to little infants.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words,
<note place="margin">Diſcip. c. XI. art. VI. Obſerv. p. 166.</note> 
                     <hi>Teach and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize,</hi> did a long time perplexe our Reformers, and occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to ſay till the yeare 1614. that it <hi>was not lawfull to baptize with out a precedent or an immediately ſubſequent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> This is what was decided in the Synod of Tonneins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to all the precedent Synods. But in the Synod of Caſtres in 1626. they begun to relaxe as to this point, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41280:124"/>it was reſolved <hi>not to preſs the obſervance of the regulation of Tonneins.</hi> Laſtly in the Synod of Charinton in 1631. (in which they admitted the Lutherans to the Supper) it was declared, <hi>that preaching before or after Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, appertaines not to the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it, but to diſcipline of which the Church has pover to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> So that what they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and practiſed ſo long, as preſcribed by JESUS-CHRIST himſelfe, was changed; and without any teſtimony of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture they declared that it was a thing concerning which the Church might ordaine as she pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>As for little infants, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformers ſay verry well that their Baptiſme is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Scripture, but they cite no expreſſe paſſage, and they argue from farfetched, not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41280:124"/>to ſay doubtfull yea and even falſe conſequences.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that all the proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes they can draw from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture upon this ſubject have no force, and that they themſelves deſtroy thoſe that might have any.</p>
                  <p>That which might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to eſtablish the Baptiſme of little infants,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.10.</note> is that on the one ſide it is written JESUS-CHRIST <hi>is the Saviour of all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 19.14.</note> and that he himſelfe has ſaid, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto mee;</hi> and on the other, that he has prononced none can come unto him, nor have any part in him, if he do not receive Baptiſme, conformable to theſe words:
<note place="margin">John. 3.3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>If you be not borne again of water and the Holy Spirit, you shall not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> But theſe paſſages have no force according to the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41280:125"/>doctrine of our Reformers, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce they beleeve it as of faith that Baptiſme is not neceſſary to the ſalvation of infants.</p>
                  <p>Nothing affords them more difficulty in their Diſcipline,
<note place="margin">Diſcip. c. XI. art. VI. Obſerv.</note> then to ſee every day that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety of Parents of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to have their little children baptized when they are ſick or in danger of death. This piety of the parents is called in their Synods, <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</hi> It is a weakneſſe to fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re leaſt the children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full should dye without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Baptiſme. One Synode went ſo far as to permit them to baptize their children ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily <hi>in evident danger of death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But the following Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod reprehended <hi>this weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe;</hi> and theſe ſtrong in faith effaced that clauſe where they teſtifyed ſome regarde to that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41280:125"/>danger; <hi>becauſe it gives ſome ouverture to the opinion of the neceſſity of Baptiſme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the proofs drawn from the neceſſity of Baptiſme to oblige the giving of it to little infants, are deſtroyed by our Reformers. Let us ſee thoſe they ſubſtitute in their place, ſuch as are inſerted in their Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, in their Confeſſion of faith,
<note place="margin">Cat. Dim 50. Conf. de Foy art. 35. Forme d'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrer le Bapt.</note> and in their prayers. That is that the children of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are borne in alliance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this promis: <hi>I shall be thy God, and the God of thy ſeede to a thouſand generations.</hi> From whence they conclude that <hi>the vertue and ſubſtance of Baptiſme appertaining to little children, they should do them an injury to deny them the ſigne which is inferiour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the like reaſon they will finde themſelves obliged to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41280:126"/>them the Supper togeather with Baptiſme; for thoſe who are in the alliance, are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated to JESUS-CHRIST: the little children of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are in the alliance; they are therefore incorporated to JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS-CHRIST; and having by this meanes (according to them) the vertue and ſubſtance of the Supper, it ought to be ſaid as of Baptiſme, that the ſigne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be refuſed them without injury.</p>
                  <p>The Anabaptiſts maintaine that theſe words, <hi>let a man trye himſelve and ſo let him eat,</hi> have no greater force to exact yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of diſcretion to receive the Supper, then theſe, <hi>hee that shall beleeve and shall be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> have to exact them in Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the new Reformers
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41280:126"/>from the alliance of the antient people and from Circumciſion mooves them not. The allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the antient people (ſay they) was contracted by birth becauſe it was carnall; and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this account the ſeale was printed in the flesh by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion immediately after birth. But in the new alliance, it dos not ſuffiſe to be borne, wee muſt be newborne to enter into it: and as the two alliances have nothing of reſemblance, there is nothing ſay they to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from one ſign to another, ſo that the comparaiſon which they make of Circumciſion with Baptiſme is voide and of no effect.</p>
                  <p>Experience has shown that all the attempts of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers whereby to confound the Anabaptiſt from Scripture, has beene weake and feeble. So
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41280:127"/>that at the laſt they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to plead practiſe. Wee fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in their Diſcipline at the end of the XI. chapter, the forme of receiving perſons of a more advanced age int their Communion, where they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the Anabaptiſt who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted acknowledge that the Baptiſme of little infants <hi>has its foundation in Scripture and in the perpetuall practiſe of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers beleeve they have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God it is not their cuſtome to ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the perpetuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Church. But here where the Scripture furnis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heth them with nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſtop the mouths of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, they were neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſupport themſelves el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe where, and at the ſame time
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41280:127"/>to acknowledge that in theſe matters the perpetuall practiſe of theſe Church is of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable authority.</p>
                  <p>Let us come now to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. The Pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers boaſt they have found in theſe words, <hi>Drinke ye all of it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 26.27.</note> an expreſſe command for all the faithfull to participate of the cupp. But if wee tell them that theſe words were addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Apoſtles only who were preſent, and had their entire accomplishment when in effect they all drunke of it, as Saint Mark ſays,
<note place="margin">Mark. 14.23.</note> What refuge will they finde in Scripture? Where can they finde that theſe words of JESUS-CHRIST, <hi>Drinke ye all of it,</hi> are to be applyed to any others then to thoſe to whom the ſame JESUS-CHRIST ſaid, <hi>Do this?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22.19.</note> But
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41280:128"/>theſe words, <hi>Do this,</hi> regard only the Miniſters of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, who alone can do what JESUS-CHRIST did, that is to ſay conſecrate and diſtribute the Euchariſt as well as receive it. By what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will they prove that theſe other words, <hi>Drinke ye all of it,</hi> have a further extent? But if they ſay that ſome words of our Lord regard all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and others the Miniſters only, what rule will they fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de us in Scripture whereby to diſtinguish which appertaine to the one and which to the others, ſeeing JESUS-CHRIST ſpeakes every where after the ſame manner, and without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction? But in fine let it be as it will, ſay ſome of them, theſe words of JESUS-CHRIST. <hi>Do this,</hi> addreſſed to the Holy Apoſtles, and in them to all Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41280:128"/>decide the queſtion, ſeing that in ſaying to them, <hi>Do this,</hi> he ordaines them to do all that he did, by conſequence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all that he diſtributed; and in a word to cauſe to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by all ſucceding ages what JESUS-CHRIST had cauſed them to do. This is in effect the moſt plauſible thing they can ſay; But they are nothing the wiſer, when wee shew them ſo many things done by JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS-CHRIST in this myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which they do not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve themſelves obliged to do. For what rule have they to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the diſtinction? And ſince that JESUS-CHRIST com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all he did under this ſame word, <hi>Do this,</hi> without explicating himſelfe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what other thing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, except Tradition, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish what is eſſentiall from
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41280:129"/>what is not? This argument is without anſwer, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ſo much the more to be ſo, by how much wee shall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re exactly deſcended to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>JESUS-CHRIST inſtituted this Sacrament in the evening, at the beginning <hi>of the night in which he was to be delivered.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.23.</note> It was at this time he would lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve us <hi>his Body given for us:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22.19.</note> To conſecrate at that ſame hower would be to render the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his paſſion more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with all to repreſent that JESUS-CHRIST was to dye at <hi>the laſt hower,</hi> that is to ſay, in the laſt period of times. Notwithſtanding none beleeve theſe words, <hi>Do this,</hi> binde us to an hower ſo full of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>The Church has made a law to take that faſting which
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41280:129"/>JESUS-CHRIST gave after Supper.</p>
                  <p>If wee regard Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the words of JESUS-CHRIST which are aſſerted in it, the Pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers will never have any thing of certain as to what relates to the Miniſter of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. The Anabaptiſts and other ſuch like ſects, beleeve each Faithfull may give this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his family without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of another Miniſter. The Pretended Reformers can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver convince them by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re only. They cannot proove againſt them that theſe words, <hi>Do this,</hi> were addreſſed to the Apoſtles only, if theſe, <hi>Drinke yee all of it,</hi> prononced in the following part of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and with as little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, were addreſſed to all the faithfull, as they tell us eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41280:130"/>day. And on the other ſide it will be anſwered that the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to whom JESUS-CHRIST ſaid, <hi>Do this,</hi> aſſiſted at his holy Table as ſimple communicants, and not as perſons conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nor diſtributing or as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: from whence it may be concluded that theſe words do not confer upon them any Miniſtry in particular. And in short it could not be decided but by the help of Tradition that this Sacrament had any Miniſters ſpecially eſtablished by the Son of God, or that theſe Miniſters ought to be thoſe to whom he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the charge of preaching his word.</p>
                  <p>This is that which made Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian ſay in his booke <hi>De co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona militis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De cor. mil. c. 3.</note> that wee learne from unwritten Tradition on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Euchariſt <hi>ought not

                     <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoug the comiſſion to give it</hi> (if wee regarde preciſely the words of JESUS-CHRIST) <hi>was addreſſed to all the faithfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Tradition which declares the Paſtors of the Church ſole Miniſters of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, teaches us that the ſecond or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe Miniſters, that is to ſay, the Prieſts have part in this honour, although JESUS-CHRIST ſaid not, <hi>Do this,</hi> but to the Apoſtles only, who were the heads of his flock.</p>
                  <p>Wee do not read that our Lord gave his Body or his Blood to each of his Diſciples; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that in breaking the Bread he ſaid to them, <hi>Take and eate;</hi> and as for the Cupp, it is likely that having placed it in the mideſt of them he ordained them to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41280:131"/>of it one after the other. The Synod of Privas, one of the Pretended Reformation,
<note place="margin">Diſc c. XII. art. IX.</note> mentioned in the IX. Article of the XII. chapter of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, ſayes, that <hi>our Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Apoſtle to diſtribute the Bread and the Cupp one to the other, and from hand, to hand;</hi> But though JESUS-CHRIST did do it after this manner, conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant practiſe has interpreted that the conſecrated Bread and Wine should be given to the faithfull by the Miniſters of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Conformably to the example of our Lord and the Apoſtles ſome of the Pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers would have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants to give the Cupp to one another;
<note place="margin">Syn. de Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas, ibid. Syn. de Saint Maixent. Diſc. c. XII. Obſervat. aprés l'art. XIV.</note> and it is certain this Ceremony was a ſolemne ſigne of union. But the Synods of the Pretended Reformers did not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41280:131"/>judge it neceſſary to follow he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein what they acknowledged to have been practiſed by JESUS-CHRIST and his Apoſtles in the inſtitution of the Supper, and on the contrary they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Paſtors only the diſtribution of the Cupp, as well as of the Bread.</p>
                  <p>All Antiquity allowes to Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons the diſtribution of the Cupp,
<note place="margin">Conc. Carth. IV. c. 38. &amp;c.</note> though neither JESUS-CHRIST nor his Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained any thing of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that appeares in Scripture: None ever oppoſed it, and the Pretended Reformers approve this practiſe in ſome of their Synods quoted amongſt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon the IX.
<note place="margin">Diſc. c. XII. Obſerv. ſur l'art. IX.</note> article of the chapter concerning the Supper.</p>
                  <p>They have ſince that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this practiſe,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſole Paſtors the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41280:132"/>of the Euchariſt, yea even that of the Cupp to the excluſion of Deacons, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themſelves though they ſeeme amongſt them to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſecond order of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church, that is that of Prieſts, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſtantly offered and diſtributed not only the Sacred Chalice, but moreover the whole entire Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>Our Pretended Reformers did not at firſt arrive to this deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<note place="margin">Ibid. Obſerv. p. 184. &amp; ſeq.</note> Their firſt Synods ſaid that the Miniſters only should adminiſter the Coupp <hi>as far as it might be done.</hi> This reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction continued under two and twenty ſucceſſive nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, evento that of alais which was held in our dayes in 1620. There they ordained that theſe words, <hi>as far as it might be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> should be expunged, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41280:132"/>the adminiſtration of the Cupp was reſerved to the Miniſters alone. Till that time the Elders and the Deacons alſo had upon occaſion adminiſtred the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and principally the Cupp.
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 186.</note> The Church of Geneva formed by Calvin had this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and it was but in the yeare 1623. that they there reſolved to conforme themſelves to the ſentiment of thoſe of France. This buſineſſe did not paſſe without contradiction in the Provinces. The reaſon of the Synod of Alais, as it is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the diſcipline, is <hi>that it appartained only to the lawfully eſtablished Paſtors to diſtribute this Sacrament:</hi> a Maxime which viſibly regards Doctrine, and which by conſequence (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Principles of the new Reformation) ought to be found expreſſely in Scripture;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41280:133"/>from whence it followes that all the Synods and Pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches untill that of Alais did groſſely erre againſt the inſtitution of JESUS-CHRIST. Or if they anſwer us that theſe words were not verry cleare (as theſe variations ſeeme ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to shew;) they ought to acknewledge with us, that to underſtand theſe words a man is obliged to have recourſe to the interpretation of the Church, and to that Tradition which ſubjects us to her.</p>
                  <p>To be aſſembled togeather at the ſame Table is a ſigne of ſociety and Communion which JESUS-CHRIST would have to appeare in the inſtitution of his Sacrament, for he was at Table with his Apoſtles.
<note place="margin">Ibid. Obſerv. aprés l'art. XIV. p. 189.</note> Some Churches of the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reformers to imitate this example, and to do all that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41280:133"/>our Lord had done <hi>ranged the Communicants by table-fulls.</hi> The Synod of Saint Maixent cited in the ſame place rejects this obſervance.</p>
                  <p>What was there ſeemingly more oppoſite to what had been practiſed at the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the cuſtome of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away with them the Communion, and of receiving it in private? Wee have ſeen notwithſtanding that this was practiſed in the primitive ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of martyrdome not to ſay any thing here of the follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing ages.</p>
                  <p>There appeares nothing in Scripture of the reſerving (as it should be) the Euchariſt for the uſe of the ſick: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe wee finde it practiſed from the very originall of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who mixed the two
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41280:134"/>ſpecies, and tooke them both togeather appeared as much eſtrainged from the tearmes and deſigne of the inſtitution as thoſe who received under one only. Theſe two articles have had their approbation in the Church, and the practiſe of mixing, which diſpleaſes our Pretended Reformers the leaſt, is that which wee finde the moſt forbiden.</p>

                  <p>The moſt important thing in the Sacraments is the words which give efficacy to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. JESUS-CHRIST has not expreſſely preſcribed any for the Euchariſt in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles. JESUS-CHRIST in ſaying, <hi>Do this,</hi> only inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they should repete his proper words by which the bread and wine were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But that which has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined us invincibly to this ſenſe is Tradition. Tradition
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41280:135"/>has alſo regulated thoſe prayers which ought to be joyned to the words of JESUS-CHRIST; and it is upon this account Saint Baſil in his booke of the Holy-Ghoſt places amongſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions,
<note place="margin">Baſil. de Sp. S. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>the words of invocation which are made uſe of in conſecration,</hi> or to render it word for word, <hi>when the Euchariſt is shown.</hi>

                  <p>By the VIII. article of the XII. chapter of the Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, it is left indifferent to the Paſtors to uſe the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med words in the diſtribution of the Supper. The article is of the Synods of Sainte-Foy, and of Figeac in the yeares 1578. and 1579. And in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it appeares in the Synod of Privas held in the yeare 1612.
<note place="margin">Ibid. Obſerv. ſur l'art. IX. p. 185.</note> 
                     <hi>that in the Church of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva the Deacons do not ſpeake,

In the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Synod of Privas,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons who give the Cupp are forbidden to ſpeake, becauſe JESUS-CHRIST <hi>ſpoke alone;</hi> and the Church of Mets is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to conforme <hi>in this to the example of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST <hi>without nevertheleſſe uſing any violence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The example of JESUS-CHRIST do's not therefore make a law, according to this Synod; and according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Synods it is freely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſeperate in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Sacrament, the words which are indeed the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41280:136"/>ſoule of the Sacraments, as the example of Baptiſme may make apparent, not to alledge here the harmonious conſent of the whole Chriſtian world, and of all ages.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſee by theſe deciſions that what JESUS-CHRIST did dos not appeare to be a law to the Pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. A diſtinction muſt be made betwixt that which is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and that which is not ſo. JESUS-CHRIST dit not do it himſelfe, he only ſpoke in general, <hi>Do this.</hi> It belongs therefore to the Church to do it, and her conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ought to be an unviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble law.</p>
                  <p>But in fine to attache our Miniſters in their own fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, ſeeing they place the ſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of their argument for the moſt part in theſe words, <hi>Do
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41280:136"/>this:</hi> let us ſee when JESUS-CHRIST pronounced them.</p>
                  <p>He dit not pronounce them until after he had ſaid, <hi>Take,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22.19.</note> 
                     <hi>eat, this is my Body.</hi> For it is then that Saint Luke alone makes him add, <hi>Do this in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of me;</hi> this Evangeliſt not mentioning that he ſaid the like after the Chalice.</p>
                  <p>It is true Saint Paul men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that after the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chalice, JESUS-CHRIST ſaid,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.23.</note> 
                     <hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me ſo often as you shall drinke.</hi> But after all, this diſcourſe of our Saviour, to take it in rigour and in its preciſe tearmes, imports only a conditionall ordre, <hi>to do this in remembrance of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST <hi>as often as one shall do it,</hi> and not an order abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to do it: the which I could prove by Proteſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41280:137"/>if the thing were not of it ſelfe too cleare to neede a proofe.</p>
                  <p>And thus the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> would be found abſolutely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to theſe words only, <hi>Take, eate,</hi> and the Proteſtants would looſe their cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But if they ſay, as ſome of theirs do, that theſe words at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the reception of the Body, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> have the ſame force as theſe which are ſaide after the Chalice, <hi>As often as you shall drinke do it in remembrance of me,</hi> the one as well as the other ordaining only <hi>to do it in remembrance:</hi> and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely their cauſe will be but the worſe, becauſe on that account there will not remaine in the whole Goſpel any abſolute precept (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their doctrine) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41280:137"/>either of the ſpecies much leſſe both.</p>
                  <p>It ſerves them for nothing to anſwer that the inſtitution of JESUS-CHRIST ſuffices them, ſeeing the queſtion alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tournes to know what appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the eſſence of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, JESUS-CHRIST not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſtinguished it, and all the foregoing examples demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting invincibly that it cannot be learnd but from Tradition.</p>
                  <p>If they add, that in all caſes they cannot be deceived in doing what is written, and what JESUS-CHRIST did: this is with a ſeeming reaſon to leave the difficulty untouched, becauſe on the one ſide they have ſeene ſo many things which ought to be obſerved though they be not regulated in Scripture; and on the other part they ſee alſo ſo great a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41280:138"/>number of thoſe that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and done by JESUS-CHRIST, which are not obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, without finding any thing in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re which can aſſure them they are leſſe important then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>So that without the aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Tradition wee should not know how to conſecrate, how to give, how to receive, nor in a word how to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, no more then that of Baptiſme; and this diſcuſſion may aide us to underſtand with how much reaſon Saint Baſil ſaid, that in rejecting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Tradition <hi>the Goſpel it ſelfe is attached and Preaching is reduced to meere words,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Baſil. de Sp. S. cap. 27.</note> the meaning of which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
                  <p>In effect all the anſwers and

                  <p>If therefore she has alwayes beleeved the grace of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was not reſtrained to both ſpecies; if she has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one or both ſpecies was a ſaving Communion; if the Pretended Reformers have followed this ſentiment in a certain caſe not mentioned in the Goſpel, that is to ſay, in regard of thoſe who drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke no wine: what difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be founde in a thing regulated by ſuch certain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

                  <p>There are many other reaſons which induce us to think, that the uſage of one ſole ſpecies bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan on great feſtivalls, by reaſon of the multitude of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants;

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41280:142"/>and the Catalogus of his errors are regiſtred: by which it appears, that either he did not inſiſt upon that point, or that there was no great ſtir made about it.</p>
                  <p>Calixtus agrees with Aeneas Sylvius an Author neere thoſe times,
<note place="margin">N. 24.25. an author about thoſe times.</note> who writ this Hiſtory, that the firſt who mooved that Queſtion was one named Peter Dreſde School-Maſter of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and he made uſe againſt us of the authority of that Paſſage in S. John: <hi>If ye eat not the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink not his Bloud you shall have no life in you.</hi> This Paſſage miſſed Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel de Miſne who cauſed the whole Church of Bohemia, towards the end of the XIV. age to revolt. He was followed by John Hus in the begining of the XV. age ſo that the conteſt between us about the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41280:142"/>two ſpecies has no higher an originall.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it muſt be remor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that John Hus did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume at firſt to ſay that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under both ſpecies was neceſſary:
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>It ſuffiſed him that they should grant it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and expedient to give it; but he ditermined not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it:</hi> ſo certaine and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablished a thing it was, there was no ſuch neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>When any change of eſſentiall cuſtomes is made, the ſpirit of Tradition always living in the Church, is never wanting to make an oppoſition. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters withall there great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, find yet very great difficulty to accuſtome their people to ſee their children dye without Baptiſme, and in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of the opinion they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into them, that Baptiſme
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:41280:143"/>is not neceſſary to ſalvation, they are not able to divert the trouble ſo funeſt an event pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in them, nor ſcarce reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traine the Fathers who abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require their children should be Baptiſed in that neceſſity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ancient cuſtome. I my ſelf have obſerved it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and the ſame may be ſeen by what I have cited out of their Synodes: ſo true it is that a cuſtome which an immemoriall and univerſall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hath imprinted in their mindes as neceſſary hath an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſiſtable power; and ſo fare are men from being able to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish ſuch a ſentiment in the wholl Church, that it is very dificult even to extinguish it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who with a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate reſolution contradict it. If there fore the Communion under one ſole ſpecies hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:41280:143"/>without contradiction, and without noyſe, it is, as we have ſaid, that all Chriſtians from the infancie of Chriſtianity were nourished in that faith; that the ſame vertue was diffuſed in either of the two ſpecies, and that nothing of the ſubſtance was loſt when but one of them only was received.</p>
                  <p>It was not needfull to uſe any extraordinary effort to make the faithfull enter into this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent. The Communion of infants, the Communion of the ſick, domeſtick Communion, the cuſtome to communicate under one or both ſpecies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diferently in the Church it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and in holy aſſemblies, and in fine thoſe other things we have ſeen, had naturally inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the faithfull with this ſentiment from the firſt ages of the Church.</p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:41280:144"/>
                  <p>So when John of Pick ham Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chbishop of Cantorbury in the XIII.
<note place="margin">Conc. Lameth. C. I. T. XI. Conc.</note> age with ſo much care cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his people to be taught, <hi>that under that one ſole ſpecies they had diſtributed to them, they received</hi> JESUS-CHRIST <hi>whole and intire,</hi> it paſt without the leſt difficulty, and not one perſone in the leaſt contradicted it.</p>
                  <p>It would be cavilling to ſay that this great care makes it appear, they mett with ſome oppoſition in it, becauſe we have already ſeen that William Archbishop of Chalons, and Hugo de Sainto Victore, (not to aſcend any higher at preſent) had conſtantly taught above a hundred yeares before him, the ſame doctrine, not one finding in it any thing either new or ſtrange: ſo much naturally dos it take an impreſſion in the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. We ſee in all times and in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41280:144"/>all places the Paſtorall charity carefull to prevent even the leaſt thoughts which ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce might chance to let fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minds of men. And in fine it is de facto certain, that there was neither complaint nor contradiction upon this article during many ages.</p>
                  <p>I doe alſo poſitively averre that not one of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived the reall preſence ever ingenuouſly called in doubt this integrity, that I may ſo ſay, of the perſon of JESUS-CHRIST under each ſpecies, ſeing it would have been to give a dead body, to give a body without blood and without ſoul, the very thoughts of which ſtrikes a horrour.</p>
                  <p>From whence it comes that in beleiving the reall preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, one is carried to beleive the full ſufficiency of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41280:145"/>under one ſpecies. We ſee alſo that Luther was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally induced to this opinion, and a good while after he had made a publick revolte from the Church, it is certain that he had the matter ſtill as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, or at leaſt of ſmall importance, highly cenſuring Carloſtadius, who had, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his advice eſtablished Communion under both kinds, and who ſeemed,
<note place="margin">Ep. Luth. ad Caſp. Guttol. Tom. II. Ep. 56.</note> ſaid he, to place the whole reforme in <hi>theſe things of nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He alſo uttered theſe inſolent words in the Treatiſe which he published in 1523. upon the formula of the Maſſe: <hi>If a Councill ordained or permited the two ſpecies, wee would in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that Councill receive but one of them, or we would neither take the one or the other, and curſe thoſe whoreceive both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:41280:145"/>vertue of that Ordinance:</hi> words which shew clearly that when both he and thoſe of his party are of late ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately zealous for the two ſpecies, it is rather out of a ſpirit of contradiction then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſollid reaſon.</p>
                  <p>In effect he approoved the ſame year the common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Melancton, where he putts amongſt things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Communion under one or both ſpecies. In 1528.
<note place="margin">Viſit. Sax. T. VI. Ihen.</note> in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of Saxony he left them expreſſy the liberty to receive but one only, and perſiſted ſtill in that opinion in 1533. five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years after he had erected himſelfe as a Reformer.</p>
                  <p>The whole Lutheran party ſuppoſes that nothing either eſſentiall or neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is loſt, when one doth not communicate under both
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41280:146"/>ſpecies, ſeeing that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the Confeſſion of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourge (a treatiſe as authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique with that party, as the Confeſſion of Ausbourge it ſelf, and equally ſubſcribed to by all thoſe who embraced it) it is expreſly ſet downe,
<note place="margin">Apol. Aug. Conſ.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Church is worthy of excuſe for not having received but one ſole ſpecies, when shee could not have both. But the caſe is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in regard to the authors of this injuſtice.</hi> What a notion of the Church is this which they repreſent to us before Luthers time as forced to receive but halfe of the Sacrament by the fault of her Paſtors! as if the Paſtors themſelves were not by the inſtitution of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, a part of the Church. But in fine it appears from hence (by the conceſſion of the Lutherans) that what
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:41280:146"/>
                     <hi>diſtroyed the Church,</hi> according to them, was not abſolutly eſſentiall, ſeeing it can never be excuſable nor tolerable to receive the Sacraments, upon what account ſoever contrary to the eſſence of their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments is no leſs eſſentiall to the Church, then the pure preaching the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Calixtus who relates careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all theſe paſſages,
<note place="margin">N. 199.</note> excuſes Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the firſt authors of the Reformation, <hi>upon this account that haveing undertook</hi> (ſee here a memorable acknowledgment, and a worthy beginning of the Reformation) <hi>upon this account</hi> (ſais Calixtus) <hi>that the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors having undertaken it</hi> (the Reformation) <hi>rather by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of others then by any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motive,</hi> that is to ſay
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41280:147"/>rather out of a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, then out of a ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re love of truth, <hi>they could not at firſt diſcover the neceſſity of the precept to communicate under both kinds, nor reject that cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> behold what Calixtus ſaith, and he ſees not how much himſelfe over throwes the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he attributed to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in makieng it apparently unknown to the firſt authors of that new Reformation, and by thoſe whom they beleeved choſen from God for this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke. Could not they have percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a thing, which Calixtus fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſo cleare? or has not Calix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus overdone it, when he gives us that for ſo clear and manifeſt which is not at all perceived by ſuch Doctors?</p>
                  <p>But to ſay no more of them, Calixtus himſelf, that very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus who has writ ſo much
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41280:147"/>againſt the Communion under one kind, in the end of the ſame treatiſe where he hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it ſo much, is ſo far from treating of it as a matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re on ſalvation depends that he declares,
<note place="margin">De Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nione ſub u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traque n. 200. &amp; jud. n. 76.</note> 
                     <hi>he does not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de from the number of the truely Faithfull our anceſters who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated under one kind above five hundred years ſince,</hi> and that which is much more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>now thoſe who communicate ſo at this very day ſeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe</hi> no better, and concludes in generall that whatever we think or what ewer we practiſe concerning the Sacrament, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put any obſtacle to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, nor a warrantable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſeparation, becaus the reception of this Sacrament is not of eſſentiall obligation. Whether this principle of Calix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus be true and the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:41280:148"/>rightly drawn from it is not our preſent diſpute. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fore that this zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the two kinds is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at laſt to grant, that a man may be le ſaved in that Church where there is but one kind on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received: by which he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to aknowlegd, either that a man may obteine ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the true Church, which certainly he will not grant, or, which he will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as little, that the true Church may remainſuch, and yet want a ſacrament, or, which is more naturall, and what we alſo in effect doe affirm, that Communion under both kinds is not eſſentiall to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>Behold whether theſe great diſputes againſt Communion under one kind tende. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having exerciſed all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telty

                  <p>He propoſes nothing new upon the Goſpels and the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:41280:149"/>of Saint Paul concerning which we have ſufficiently ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. From the Apoſtles times he paſſes to the following a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where he showes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, that the uſe of the two ſpecies was ordinary. But he ſoon perceived that he brought nothing againſt us if he ſaid nothing elſe: for he knows very well we mentain that at the ſame time the two ſpecies, were in practiſe they were not beleived ſo neceſſary but that they communicated as often and as publickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one only, without any ones complaint. To take away this our defence, and to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concluding, it did not ſuffiſe to aſſure us that the uſe of the two ſpecies was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent but he ought alſo to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us that it was regarded a indiſpenſable, and that they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41280:149"/>never communicated after any other manner. M. Jurieux found that he ought to ſay this: he has ſaid it in effect; but he has not ſo much as offered to proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve it, ſo much did he diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of ſucceding in it. Only by a bold, and vehement affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he thought he might ſupply the defect of a proof which he wanted: <hi>It is</hi> (ſaye he) <hi>a thing notoriouſly known, and that as no need of proof, tis a matter not in the leaſt queſtioned.</hi> Theſe affirmative manner of ſpeeches impoſe upon men: the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformers beleive a Miniſter upon his word, and cannot imagin he dars ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to avouch any thing as not conteſted when de facto it is. Nevertheleſs the truth, is that there is not any thing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more conteſted, but alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re falſe then that which M. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieux
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41280:150"/>gives us here as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable as equally confeſſed by both parties.</p>
                  <p>But let us conſider his words as they lye with what followes. <hi>This is</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>an affaire which is not conteſted. During the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of above a thouſand yeares, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in the Church, had ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to celebrate this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and communicate the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full otherwiſe then the Lord had commanded it, that is to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both ſpecies; except when to communicate the ſick with more facility, ſome undertooke to moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the bread in the wine, and to make them receive both the one and the other kinde at the ſame time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The propoſition and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception are neither the one nor the other made with ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>The propoſition is, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41280:150"/>the ſpace of above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares none had ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to celebrate this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, nor to give it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then under both ſpecies. He confounds at the very firſt two very different things, to celebrate this Sacrament and to give it. None ever celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it but under both ſpecies; wee grant it, and wee have shown a reaſon for it drawn from the nature of a Sacrifiſe: but that none ever gave the two ſpecies, is what wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and good ordre, not to ſay ſincerity, dit not permitt that theſe two things should be equally joyned togeather as indiſputable.</p>
                  <p>But that which ſeemes moſt intolerable, is that it should be aſſerted that during the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of above a thouſand yeares the Communion was never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41280:151"/>but under both ſpecies, and that this alſo should be a thing <hi>notorious and publick, a thing which needs no proofe, a thing which is not conteſted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee ought to regard publick faith, and not to abuſe theſe weighty expreſſions. M. Jurieux knows in his own conſcience that wee deny all he here ſayes: the ſole titles of the articles of the firſt part of this diſcourſe show clearly enough how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions there are where wee uphold that Communion was given under one kinde: I am not the firſt that have ſaid it (God forbid) and I do nothing but explicate what all other Catholicks have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</p>
                  <p>But can any thing be leſſe ſincere, then to bring here no exception from ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions but only that of the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41280:151"/>ſick, and with all to finde the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re no difference but in this that they then mixed the two ſpecies togeather: ſeeing M. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieux would relate nothing but what is not conteſted by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, he ought to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke after another manner. He knows very well wee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that the Communion of the ſick conſiſted not in giving them the two ſpecies mixed, but in giving them ordinaryly the ſole ſpecies of bread. He knows very well what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſay upon the Communion of Serapion, upon that of Saint Ambroſe, upon others which I have remarked; and that in a word wee ſay the ordinary manner of communicating the ſick was to communicate them under one ſole ſpecies. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to much to dare to deny a matter of fact ſo well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41280:152"/>but to advance this boldneſſe to ſuch a height as to ſay the contrary is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, is what I know not how M. Jurieux could reſolve upon.</p>
                  <p>But what is it he would be at, when he affirmes, as a thing not conteſted by us, that <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpace of above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares the Communion was never given otherwiſe then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both ſpecies, except in the Communion of the ſick where both the ſpecies were given mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed togeather.</hi> What a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge kind of exception is this, <hi>Both ſpecies were alwayes given, except when they gave them both mixed togeather.</hi> M. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieux would willingly have ſaid much better then he did. But in affirming, as he does, that during the ſpace of above a thouſand yeares they never
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41280:152"/>gave the Communion but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both ſpecies, he ſaw verry well that he ought at leaſt to except the communion of the ſick. He would have done it had he proceded candidly, but at the ſame time he foreſaw by this exception alone he loſt the fruict of ſo univerſall a propoſition; and otherwiſe, there was not any likelihood the antient Church ſent dying perſons to the Tribunall of JESUS-CHRIST after a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion received contrary to his command. So that he durſt not ſay what naturally occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and fell into a manifeſt labarynth.</p>
                  <p>In fine, wherefore ſpeakes he only of the Communion of the ſick? Whence comes it that in this relation he has ſaid nothing of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of infants, and domeſtick
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41280:153"/>Communion, both which he knows verry well wee alledge as given under one ſpecies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Why do's he diſſemble what our Authors have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, what I have proved after them by the Decrees of Saint Leo and Saint Gelaſius; that it was free to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate under one or both ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I ſay in the Church it ſelfe, and at the publick Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe? Was M. Jurieux ignorant of theſe things to ſay nothing of the reſt? Was he ignorant of the Office of Good Friday, and of the Communion then and there under one ſole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? A man ſo learned as he, did he not know what was writ concerning this by Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius and Authors of the VIII. and IX. ages, whom wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve quoted? To know theſe things and to affirme as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpautable
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:41280:153"/>practiſe, <hi>that during the ſpace of above a thouſand yeares the Communion was never given but under both ſpecies:</hi> is it not manifeſtly to be tray the truth, and defile his own conſcience?</p>
                  <p>The other Authors of his Communion who have writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us act with more ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Calixtus, M. du Bourdieu and the others endeavour to anſwer thoſe objections wee make. M. Jurieux followes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother method, and contents himſelfe to ſay boldly, <hi>That during the ſpace of above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares none ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to communicate the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full otherwiſe then under both ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and that this matter is not conteſted.</hi> This is the shorteſt way; and the ſureſt to decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the ſimple. But wee muſt beleeve that thoſe who love
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:41280:154"/>their ſalvation, will open their eyes and not ſuffer themſelves to be any longer impoſed on.</p>
                  <p>M. Jurieux has but one only remaning refuge: to witt, that theſe Communions ſo frequent in the antient Church under one ſpecies were not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of JESUS-CHRIST, any more then the Communion which is given in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in bread alone to thoſe who drinke no wine. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering after this manner, he would have anſwered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his principles, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: but after all I maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne he had not the boldneſſe to make uſe of this anſwer, nor to impute to the antient Church this monſtrous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe where a Sacrament is given which is in reality no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an humain inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Communion.</p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:41280:154"/>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe in a hiſtory ſuch as he had promiſed it was his buſineſſe to have alwayes related theſe conſiderable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact. He ſays not one word of them in his narrative I wonder not at it, for he could not have ſpoken of ſo many important practiſes, without showing that there was at the leaſt a great conteſtation bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt them and us; and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to ſay, that <hi>it is a thing which has no need of proofe, and is not conteſted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that in another pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in anſwering objections, he ſpeakes a word or two of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Communion. But he comes of in anſwering that <hi>it is not certain whether thoſe who carried away with them the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt after this manner,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. Sect. VII. 483. 484.</note> 
                     <hi>carried not alſo the wine, and that this later is much more likely.</hi> It is
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:41280:155"/>not certain: this laſt is much more apparent. Certainly a man thus poſitive as he is diffides verry much of his cauſe when he ſpeakes at this rate; but at leaſt, ſeing he doubts, he ought not to ſay that <hi>it is a matter without conteſtation, that no body ever undertooke during above a thouſand yeares to communicate the Faithfull otherwiſe then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both ſpecies.</hi> Behold even in the firſt ages of the Church an infinite number of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that he himſelfe durſt not affirme to have been under both ſpecies. It was an abuſe, ſayes he. What then? the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe was to be related; the queſtion concerning the abuſe would come after, and wee should then ſee whether or no it were fitt to condemne ſo many Martyrs, ſo many other Saints, and the whole primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:41280:155"/>Church which practiſed this domeſtick Communion.</p>
                  <p>M. Jurieux cuts of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: <hi>Is there the leaſt ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>to draw a proofe from a practiſe oppoſed to that of the Apoſtles, which is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at preſent, and which would paſſe in the Church of Rome for the worſt of crimes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was it not his buſineſſe here again to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that wee condemne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with him and his the practiſe of ſo many Saints as contrary to that of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? But wee are far from ſuch horrible temerity. M. Jurieux knows it very well; and a man who boaſts thus much of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ought to have ſo much of it as to take notice that the Church (as I have showne el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſewhere) dos not condemne
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41280:156"/>all the practiſes she changes; and that the Holy-Ghoſt who guides her, makes her not only condemne ill practiſes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to quitt good ones, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them ſeverely, when they are abuſed.</p>
                  <p>I beleeve the falſity of this Hiſtory which M. Jurieux gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves us of the firſt ages of the Church for a eleaven hundred or a thouſand yeares appeares ſufficiently: what he ſayes of following times is no leſſe contrary to truth.</p>
                  <p>I have no neede to ſpeake of the manner how he relates the eſtablishment of the reall preſence and Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during the X. age: that is not to our preſent ſubject,
<note place="margin">Sect. V. p. 469.</note> and otherwiſe nothing obliges us to refute what he advances without proofe. But that which is to be remarked is, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:41280:156"/>Communion under one kind as a thing which was not introduced but by preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Tranſubſtantiation. All in good time: when therefore it shall henceforth appeare (as wee have invincibly shown) that Communion under one ſpecies was practiſed even in the firſt ages of the Church, and in the times of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, it can be no more doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that Tranſubſtantiation was alſo at that time eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and M. Jurieux himſelfe will be obliged to grant this conſequence. But let us retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to what follows in his Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                  <p>He shows us there Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under one ſpecies, as a thing firſt thought of in the eleaventh age, after the reall preſence and Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been well eſtablished:
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:41280:157"/>For then they perceived (ſayes he) <hi>that under a crumme of bread,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. 470.</note> 
                     <hi>as well as under every drop of wine, the whole Flesh and all the Blood of our Lord were included.</hi> What happened upon it? Let us heare: <hi>This falſe reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in ſuch a manner over the inſtitution of our Lord, and over the practiſe of the whole antient Church, that the cuſtome of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating under the ſole ſpecies of Bread was inſenſibly eſtabliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed in the XII. and XIII. ages.</hi> It was inſenſibly eſtablished; ſo much the better for us. What I have ſaid then is true, that the people reduced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without contradiction and without difficulty to the ſole ſpecies of Bread, ſo well were they prepared by the Communion of the ſick, by that of infants, by that which was received at home, by that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:41280:157"/>which was practiſed in the Church it ſelfe, and finally by all thoſe practiſes wee have ſeen, to acknowlege a true and perfect Communion under one ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>This is an untoward and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome buſineſſe for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers: They have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indeed to boaſt of theſe inſenſible changes where in they putt the whole ſtreſſe of their cauſe; they never yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, neither will they ever produce one example of ſuch a change in eſſentiall matters. That indifferent matters should be inſenſibly changed and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction, is no ſuch great wonder: but (as wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ſaid) the faith of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thoſe practiſes which are beleeved eſſentiall to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are not ſo eaſily chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For then Tradition, the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41280:158"/>antient beliefe, cuſtome it ſelfe, and the Holy Ghoſt who ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the Body of the Church oppoſe themſelves to his novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When therefore a change is made without difficulty, and without being perceived, it is a ſigne the matter was never beleeved to be ſo neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>M. Jurieux ſaw this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and after having ſaid that <hi>the cuſtome of communicating under the ſole ſpecies of bread was eſtabliſed inſenſibly in the XII. and XIII. age,</hi> he adds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after: <hi>It was not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever without reſiſtance; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not ſuffer without great impatience that they should ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke from them halfe of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST; <hi>they murmured in all parts.</hi> He had ſaid a little before that this change, (ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from thoſe which are made <hi>after an inſenſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41280:158"/>without oppoſition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noiſe) was</hi> on the contrary <hi>made with great noiſe and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</hi> Theſe Gentlemen anſwer things as beſt pleaſes them: the preſent difficulty tranſports them; and beeing preſſed by the objection, they ſay at that moment what ſeemes moſt to diſentangle them from it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much reflecting whether it agree, I do not ſay with truth, but with their own thoughts. The cauſe it ſelfe demands this, and wee muſt not expect that an errour can be defended af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a conſequent manner. This is the ſtate in which M. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieux found himſelfe. <hi>This cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,</hi> ſays he, that is to ſay this of communicating under one kind, <hi>was inſenſibly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;</hi> nothing can be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quiet and tranquile. It was not nevertheleſſe without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41280:159"/>without noiſe, without the greateſt impatience, without murmuring on all ſides; behold a grand commotion. Truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de him candidly ſpeake the firſt, and the adheſion to his cauſe made him ſay the other. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nothing can be found of theſe <hi>univerſall murmurs, of theſe extreame impatiences, of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances of the people;</hi> and this induceth to the eſtabliſing an inſenſible change. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide it muſt not be ſaid that a practiſe which is repreſented ſo ſtrange, ſo unheard of, ſo evidently ſacrilegious, was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablished without repugnance, and without taking any notice of it. To avoid this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience a reſiſtance muſt be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined, and, if none can be found, invented.</p>
                  <p>But furthermore what could be the ſubject of theſe univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:41280:159"/>murmurings? M. Jurieux has told us his thoughts of them: but in this point he coheares as little with himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe as in all the reſt. That which cauſed theſe murmurings, <hi>is</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that the people ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with the greateſt impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce that they should be deprived of one halfe of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST. Has he forgot what he even now ſaid, that the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence had made them ſee that <hi>under each crumme of bread the whole Flesh and all the Blood of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST <hi>were contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 469.</note> Dos he reflect upon what he is preſently about to ſay, <hi>that if the doctrine of Tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation and of the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence be true,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sect. VI. p. 480.</note> 
                     <hi>it is true alſo that the bread containes the Flesh and the Blood of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST? Where then was this half of JESUS-CHRIST taken away,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:41280:160"/>which the people ſuffered (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him) with the higheſt impatience? If a man will have them make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, let him at leaſt afford them matter conformable to their ſentiments, and ſuch as carrys a face of probability.</p>
                  <p>But in reality there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Nor dos M. Jurieux shew us any in the Authors of that time. The firſt contradiction is that which gave occaſion to the deciſion of the Councile of Conſtance in the yeare 1415. It begun in Bohemia (as wee have ſeene) about the end of the XIV. age: and, if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the relation of M. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieux, the cuſtome of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating under one ſole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies begun in the XI. age, if they do not begin to complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and that in Bohemia only, but towards the end of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:41280:160"/>XIV. age; by the acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of this Miniſter, three hundred whole yeares should be paſſed, before a change ſo ſtrange, ſo bold, if wee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve him, ſo viſibly oppoſite to the inſtitution of JESUS CHRIST and to all precedent practiſes, should have made any noiſe. Beleive it that will: for my part I am ſenſible, that to beleeve it, all remorſe of conſcience muſt be ſtifled.</p>
                  <p>M. Jurieux muſt without doubt have ſome of them, to fee himſelfe forced by the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his cauſe to diſguiſe truth ſo many wayes in an hiſtoricall relation, that is, in a kind of diſcourſe which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others requires can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>He do's not ſo much as ſtate the queſtion ſincerely.
<note place="margin">V. Sect. p. 464.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the queſtion</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41280:161"/>very eaſy to comprehend.</hi> he will then I hope declare it clearely and diſtinctly. Let us ſee. <hi>It is granted</hi> (adds he) <hi>that when they communicate the faithfull, as well the people as the Clergy, they are obliged to give them the Bread to eate: but they pretend it is not the ſame as to the Cupp.</hi> He will not ſo much as drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that wee beleeve Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion equally vallid and perfect under eather of the two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. But beeing willing by the very ſtate of the queſtion to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve it underſtood that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive more perfection or more neceſſity in that of the Bread then in the other, or that JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS-CHRIST is not equally in them both: he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by render us manifeſtly ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. But he knows verry well that wee are far from theſe phancyes; and it may be ſeene
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41280:161"/>in this Treatiſe, that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Communion given to little children during ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages under the ſole ſpecies of wine, as good and vallid as that which was given in ſo many other occurrences under the ſole ſpecies of Bread. So that M. Jurieux ſtates the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrong. He begins his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute concerning the two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon that queſtion ſo ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: He continues it by a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory where wee have ſeene he advances as many falſityes as facts. Behold here the man whom our Reformers looke upon at preſent every where as the ſtrongeſt defendour of their cauſe.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Gentlemen of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformation muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt us here to explicate more fully this concomitancy, ſo much attaqued by their diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes; and ſeing they have let paſſe the reall preſence as a doctrine which has no veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in it, they ought not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to have ſuch an averſion from what is but a manifeſt conſequence of it.</p>
                  <p>M. Jurieux has acknowle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it in the places heretofore mentioned.
<note place="margin">Exam. p. 480.</note> 
                     <hi>If</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation and the reall preſence were true, it is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41280:163"/>true that the Bread would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Flesh and Blood of</hi> JESUS-CHRIST. So that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy is an effect of the reall preſence, and the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reformers do not deny us this conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Let them then at preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe this reall preſence, ſeing they ſuffer it in their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Lutherans, and let them conſider with us the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequences: they will ſee that our Lord could not give us his Body and his Blood perpetually ſeperated, nor give us either the one or the other without giving us his perſon whole and entire in either of the two.</p>
                  <p>Verily when he ſaid, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body,</hi> and by thoſe words gave us the flesh of his ſacrifiſe to eate, he know verry well he did not give us
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:41280:163"/>the flesh of a pure man, but that he gave us a flesh united to the divinity, and in a word the flesh of God and man both togeather. The ſame muſt be ſaid of his Blood, which would not be the price of our ſalvation, if it were not the Blood of God; Blood which the Divine Word had appropriated to himſelfe after a moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner by making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe man, conformable to theſe words of Saint Paul:
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.14.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe his ſervants are compoſed of flesh and blood; he who ought in all things to be like unto them, would partake both of the one and the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if he would not give us in his Sacrament a flesh pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humain, he would much leſſe give us in it a flesh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſoule, a dead flesh, a carcaſe, or by the ſame reaſon
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41280:164"/>a flesh deſpoiled of blood, and blood actually ſeperated from the body: otherwiſe he ought to dye often, and often to shed his Blood, a thing unworthy the glorious ſtate of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, where he ought to conſerve eternally humain nature as entire as he had at firſt aſſumed it. So that he knew verry well that wee should have in his flesh his Blood, that in his Blood wee should have his flesh, and that wee should have in both the one and the other his bleſſed ſoule with his divinity whole and entire, without which his flesh would not be quickning, nor his Blood full of ſpirit and grace.</p>
                  <p>Why then in giving us ſuch great treaſors, his holy ſoule his divinity, all that he is; why I ſay did he only name
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41280:164"/>his Body, and his Blood, if it were not to make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it is by that infirmity, which he would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with us, wee muſt arrive to his ſtrength? And why has he in his word diſtinguished this Body and this Blood, which he would not effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeperate but during that little time he was in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, if it be not to make us alſo underſtand this Body and this Blood, with which he nourisheth and quickneth us would not have the vertue, if they had not beene once actually ſeperated; and if this ſeperation had not cauſed the violent death of our Saviour by which he became our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctime? So that the vertue of this Body and this Blood co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from his death, he would conſerve the image of this
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41280:165"/>death when he gave us them in his holy Supper, and by ſo lively a repreſentation keepe us alwayes in minde to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of our ſalvation that is to ſay the ſacrifiſe of the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p>According to this doctrine, wee ought to have our living victime under an image of death; otherwiſe wee should not be enlivened. JESUS-CHRIST tells us alſo at his holy table: <hi>I am living but I have beene dead;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 1.11.</note> and living in effect I beare only upon wee the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of that death which I have endured. It is alſo thereby that I enliven, becauſe by the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of my death once ſuffered, I introduce thoſe who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, to that life which I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe eternally.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lambe who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne <hi>as dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 5.6.</note> or rather, <hi>as ſlaine,</hi> do's not ceaſe
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41280:165"/>to be living, <hi>for he is ſlanding;</hi> and he ſends throughout the world <hi>the ſeaven Spirits of God, and he takes the booke and opens it,</hi> and he fils heaven and earth with joy and with grace.</p>
                  <p>Our Reformers will not, or it may be cannot yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo high a myſtery, for it enters not into the hearts but of thoſe who are prepared by a purifyed Faith: But if they cannot underſtand it, they may at leaſt underſtand very well, that wee cannot beleeve a reall preſence of the Body and Blood of JESUS-CHRIST without admitting all the other things wee have even now explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and theſe things thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated is what wee call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy.</p>
                  <p>But as ſoone as concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is ſuppoſed, and that wee have acknowledged JESUS-CHRIST

                     <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing;</hi> and if wee underſtand it as Saint Cyrille, whoſe ſence was followed by the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Epheſus, it profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to beleeve it alone, to believe it the flesh of a pure man: but to believe it the flesh of God a flesh full of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by conſequence, of <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of life;</hi> it profiteth very much, without doubt, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in this ſtate it is full of an infinite vertue, and in it wee receive togeather with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire humanity of JESUS-CHRIST, his divinity alſo whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and the very ſource or fountaine of graces.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon it is the Son of God, who knew what he

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41280:167"/>which containe his Body and his Blood, but to his propper ſubſtance, which is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us, and togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it grace and life.</p>
                  <p>So that this paſſage of Saint John from whence, as wee have ſaid, Jacobel tooke occaſion to revolt and all Bohemia to riſe in rebellion, becomes a proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe for us. The Pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers themſelves would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to defend us, if wee would, againſt this paſſage ſo much boaſted of by Jacobel, ſeeing they owne with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, this paſſage is not to be underſtood of the Euchariſt. Calvin has ſaid it,
<note place="margin">Cal. Inſt. IV. &amp;c. Aub. lib. I. de Sacr. Euch. c. 30. &amp;c.</note> Aubertin has ſaid it, every one ſays it, and M. du Bourdieu ſays it alſo in his Treatiſe ſo often cited.
<note place="margin">Repl. ch. VI. p. 201.</note> But without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any advantage from their acknowledgements, wee on the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41280:168"/>contrary with all antiquity maintaine that a paſſage where the Flesh and Blood as well as eating and drinking are ſo often and ſo clearly diſtinguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, cannot be underſtood meerely of a communion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re eating and drinking is the ſame thing, ſuch as is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Communion, and by faith. It belongs therefore to them, and not to us, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the authority of this paſſage, where the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being to explicate the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and the fruict of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, it appeares that the Son of God places them not in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, nor in the manner of receiving his Body and his Blood, but in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and in the ſubſtance of both the one and the other. Whereupon the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for example Saint Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:41280:168"/>he who moſt certainly gave nothing but the Blood alone to little infants, as wee have ſeene ſo preciſely in his Treatiſe <hi>De lapſis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Test. ad Quir. III. 25.20.</note> dos not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſay in the ſame Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that the parents who led their children to the ſacrifiſes of Idols deprived them of the <hi>Body and Blood of our Lord:</hi> and teaches alſo in another pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce that they actually fulfill and accomplish in thoſe who have life, and by conſequence in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, by giving them nothing but the Blood, all that which is intended by theſe words: <hi>If you eate not my Flesh and drink not my Blood, you shall not have life in you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 23.</note> Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin ſayes often the ſame thing, though he had ſeene and examined in one of his Epiſtles, that paſſage of Saint Cyprian where he ſpeakes of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41280:169"/>the Communion of infants by Blood alone, without finding any thing extraordinary in this manner of communion; and that it is not to be doubted but the African Church, where Saint Auguſtin was Bishop, had retained the Tradition which Saint Cyprian ſo great a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr Bishop of Carthage, and Primate of Africa had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. The foundation of this is that the Body and Blood inſeperably accompany each other, for although the ſpecies which containe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the one or the other in vertue of the inſtitution are taken ſeperately, their ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce can be no more ſeperated then their vertue and their grace: in ſo much that infants in drinking only the Blood, do not only receive the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall fruit of the Euchariſt, but
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:41280:169"/>alſo the whole ſubſtance of this Sacrament, and in a word an actuall and perfect Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things shew ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the reaſon wee have to believe that Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one or both ſpecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, togeather with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Sacrament the whole effect eſſentiall to it. The practiſe of all ages which have explained it in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, has its reaſon grounded both in the foundation of the myſtery, and in the words themſelves of JESUS-CHRIST; and never was any cuſtome eſtablished upon more ſollid foundations, nor upon a more conſtant practiſe.</p>

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:41280:170"/>

Is it not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where JESUS-CHRIST is pleaſed to be in perſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring with himſelfe all his graces, to place the vertue of this Sacrament in the ſignes with which he is vailed rather then in his proper perſon which he gives us wholy and entirely; Is not this (I ſay) contrary to what he himſelfe has ſaid with his own mouth,

                     <hi>he who eates of this Bread shall have eternall life,</hi> (and), <hi>he who eates me shall live for me, and by me, as I my ſelfe live for my Father and by my Father?</hi>

                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:41280:171"/>
                  <p>But if M. Jurieux maintaine in deſpite of theſe words, that it dos not ſuffiſe to have JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS-CHRIST if wee have not in the Sacrament of his Body and his Blood the perfect ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of his death; as he do's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that but repete an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alread cleared, ſo I ſend him to the anſwers I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this argument, and to the undeniable examples I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ſet down, to shew that by the avouched confeſſion of his Churches, when the ſubſtance of the Sacrament is received, the ultimate perfection of its ſignification is no more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. But if this principle be true even in thoſe very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were JESUS-CHRIST is not really and ſubſtantially contained as in that of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: how much the rather is it certain in the Euchariſt,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:41280:171"/>where JESUS-CHRIST is preſent in his perſon, and what is it he can deſire more, who poſſeſſes him entirely?</p>
                  <p>But in fine, will ſome ſay, there muſt not be ſuch arguing upon expreſſe words. Seing it is your ſentiment that the VI. chapter of Saint John ought to be underſtood of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, you cannot diſpence with your ſelves in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of it as to the letter, and to give the Blood to drinke as well as the Body to eat, ſeing JESUS-CHRIST has equally prononced both of the one and of the other, <hi>If you eat not my Body and drinke not my Blood, you shall have no life in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us once ſtop the mouths of theſe obſtinate and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirits, who will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe words of JESUS-CHRIST
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41280:172"/>by their whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. I demande of them whence it comes they do not by theſe words believe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion abſolutely neceſſary for the ſalvation of all men, yea even of little infants new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptiſed. If nothing muſt be explicated let us give to them the Communion as well as to others, and if it muſt be explicated, let us explicate all by the ſame rule. I ſay by the ſame rule, becauſe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me principle and the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritè from which wee lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that Communion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is not neceſſary to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Baptiſme, teach us that the particular Communion of the Blood is not neceſſary to thoſe who have been already partakers of the Body.</p>
                  <p>The principle which shews
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41280:172"/>us that the Communion is not neceſſary to the ſalvation of little infants baptized, is that they have already received the remiſſion of ſins, and a new life in Baptiſme, becauſe they have beene thereby regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſanctifyed: in ſo much that if they should perish for want of being communicated they would perish in the ſtate of innocence and grace. The ſame principle shews alſo, that he who has received the Bread of life, has no neede of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſacred Blood, ſeing, as wee have frequently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, he has received togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Bread of life the whole ſubſtance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and togeather with that fubſtance the whole eſſentiall vertue of the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is JESUS-CHRIST him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41280:173"/>The vertue of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is to nourish the ſoule, to conſerve therein that new life it has received in Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, to confirme the union with JESUS-CHRIST, and to replenish even our bodyes with ſanctity and life: I aske whether in the very moment the Body of our Lord is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, all theſe effect be not likewiſe received, and whether the Blood can add thereunto any thing eſſentiall.</p>
                  <p>Behold what regards the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: let us come now to what regards the authority.</p>
                  <p>The authority which perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des us that Communion is not ſo neceſſary to the ſalvation of little infants as Baptiſme, is the authority of the Church. It is in effect this authority which carryes with it in the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ages, the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41280:173"/>of the Scripture; and as this authority has taught us that he who is baptiſed wants not any thing neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſo dos it alſo teach us that he who receives one ſole ſpecies, wants none of thoſe effects which the Euchariſt ought to produce in us: From hence in the very primitive times they communicated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under one or under both ſpecies, without believing they hazarded any thing of that grace which they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, though it be writt, <hi>If you do not eate my Body and drinke my Blood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 6.54.</note> 
                     <hi>you shall have no life in you;</hi> it is alſo writt after the ſame manner,
<note place="margin">John. 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>If a man be not regenerated of water and the Holy Ghoſt, he shall not enter into the Kingdome of God:</hi> The Church hath not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoud
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41280:174"/>an equall neceſſity in theſe two Sentences: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry she alwayes underſtood that Baptiſme which gives life is more neceſſary then the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt which conſerves it. But as nourishment followes birth, if the Church had not known her ſelfe taught by God, she durſt not any longtime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to Chriſtians regenerated by Baptiſme that nourishment which JESUS-CHRIST has prepared for them in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. For neither JESUS-CHRIST nor the Apoſtles ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ordained any thing left by writing concerning it. The Church then has learnt by another way, but alwayes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually certain, what she can give or take away without doing any injury to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they have nothing to do but to rely upon her faith.</p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:41280:174"/>
                  <p>Let not our adverſaryes thinke they can avoid the force of this argument, under pretence that they do not underſtand theſe two paſſages of the Goſpel as wee do. I know very well they do neither underſtand of Baptiſme with water this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage where it is ſaid, <hi>If you be not regenerated or borne again of water and the Holy Spirit,</hi> nor of the eating and drinking of the Euchariſt this other where it is writt, <hi>If you eat not and drinke not:</hi> ſo that they finde themſelves no more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by theſe paſſages to give the Euchariſt then Baptiſme to little infants. But without preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing too cloſe upon theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, let us make them only this demande. This precept, <hi>Eat you this,</hi> and <hi>drinke you all of it,</hi> which you think is ſo univerſall, dos it comprehend
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:41280:175"/>little children that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?

Wouſt wee give the victory to the Anabaptiſts who ſay they are not, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all antiquity which has acknowledged them as ſuch? But why do you except them from ſo generall a precept without any authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?

In vertue of this article of their Confeſſion of Faith, one of their natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Synods has decided, <hi>that when the queſtion shall be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the vocation of their Paſtors who have reformed the Church,

Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieux and M.

                  <p>In theſe matters and in many others which I could remarke, they have not only no holy Scripture for them, as they are obliged: but moreover they diſpenſe with themſelves to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, without having neither any reaſon or Tradition to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them.

                  <p>WEe should here have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish this diſcourſe, if charity which urges us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſalvation of theſe Gentlemen of the Pretended Reformed Religion, did not oblige us to remove ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:41280:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>which the peruſall of theſe practiſes, I have related, may perchance have raiſed in their mindes.</p>
                  <p>It is inceſſantly inculcated by the Miniſters, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy, upon which wee eſtablish the validity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under one ſpecies, is a myſtery unknown to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church, where none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mentioned as a matter of faith that togeather with the Body of our Lord, his Blood, his Soule and his Divinity were neceſſarily received. They add that this doctrine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy being, according to us, a neceſſary ſequell of the reall preſence, it may be beleeved that this reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was unhnown where they know not this concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſters retort upon us
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:41280:181"/>thoſe precautions wee alledge in our own behalfe. Wee do not finde, ſay they, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church any of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions now eſtablished in theſe later ages for keeping the Euchariſt, for exciting the people to adore it, for hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring leaſt it should be let fall upon that ground. This feare (add they) was no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſo many ages to the giving the Communion in botk kinds to all the people; and theſe new precautions ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve for nothing but to let us ſee they have a different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Euchariſt from that of the primitive times.</p>
                  <p>For a concluſion they tell us, that wee have given our ſelves an uſeleſſe trouble in proving with ſo much paines it is free to communicate under one or boath ſpecies, ſeing all that
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41280:181"/>can ariſe from this proofe is that at laſt wee muſt leave the choice to the people, and not reſtrain a liberty which JESUS-CHRIST himſelfe has given them.</p>
                  <p>But to begin with this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which ſeemes the moſt plauſible: who on the other ſide dos not ſee more cleare then the day that it is in the power of the Church to make choice of one part in things which are free, and that when she has choſen that, it ought not to be permitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne her decrees?
<note place="margin">Ep. ad Jan. lib. de Bapt. &amp;c.</note> Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin has very often affirmed, it is an inſupportable folly not to follow what has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by a generall Council or by the univerſall cuſtome of the Church. But if our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers be not diſpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Saint Auguſtin in this;
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:41280:182"/>will they themſelves allow that any one of theirs who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretenſe that Baptiſme was ſo long given by immerſion, should doubt with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts of the validity of his Baptiſme, and should be ſo obſtinate as either to make himſelfe be rebaptized, or at the leaſt to make his children be baptized according to the antient practiſe? But if he should require the Communion should be given his ſon but yet an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant under pretence, that it was given to little children during a thouſand yeares, would they eſteeme themſelves obliged to condeſcende to his deſire? On the contrary would they not treat ſuch an one and all like him, as unquiet and turbulent ſpirits who trouble the peace of the Church? Would they not tell them with the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre:

                     <hi>wee and the Church of God have not this cuſtome;</hi> and, if they have never ſo little ingenuity, would they not finde in this ſole paſſage enough to make them ſubmit to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the cuſtomes of the Church? Nay further, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the antient Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she baptized little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants which were preſented to her, yet did not alwayes with the outmoſt rigour oblige their parents to preſent them at that age, upon condition they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized them when in danger; and the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory lets us ſee many Catecumens of a more advanced age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to be ſooner bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. The Pretended Reformers who believe not the neceſſity of Baptiſme, and cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:41280:183"/>any divine precept which obliges it to be given to infants, are much more free in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<note place="margin">Diſcip. ch. XI. de Bapt. art.

Let them grant with us that the Church can make lawes in indifferent matters; and if they acknowledge from ſo many examples that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under one or both ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is of this kind, let them ceaſe to cavill with us, and to give themſelves an uſeleſſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about this matter.</p>
                  <p>But it may be they would ſay, that in theſe practiſes I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, thoſe who communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſometimes under one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, communicated alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the other; which
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:41280:183"/>ſuffices in the whole to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the precept of our Lord: as if our Lord would at the ſame time inſpire us with a fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me faith that wee looſe nothing by takind one ſpecies only, and yet oblige us under paine of damnation to receive them both; a cavill ſo manifeſt that it dos not merit to be refuted.</p>
                  <p>Wee muſt therefore at length examin once again what is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to the Euchariſt, and preſcribe our ſelves a rule to underſtand it aright. This is what theſe Gentlemen will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do, if they come not back to our principles and to the authority of Tradition. M.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:41280:184"/>
                     <hi>all circumſtances he obſerved, at being of abſolute neceſſity.</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe are his own words.

<note place="margin">Ibid. Sect. 6.474.475.</note> 
                     <hi>another was to have his throat cutt in the evening, to be roaſted, to be eaten with bitter hearbs, to be conſumed the ſame night, and nothing of it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved till the following day.</hi> He repreſents the neceſſity of all theſe ceremonyes, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſubſtance but all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.

So that wee should be reſtrained, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his principles, to all that JESUS-CHRIST did, and not only to bread and wine, but moreover to the hour, and to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:41280:184"/>the whole manner of receiving it;
<note place="margin">Sup. 2. p. art.

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But beholde one which I omitted, and which may in this place give great light.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other things which our Lord obſerved in the laſt Supper, one of thoſe which the Calviniſts believe as moſt neceſſary, is the breaking of the bread. The Lutherans are of a contrary opinion, and make uſe of round breads which they breake not. This is a matter of great conteſt betwixt theſe Gentlemen. The Calviniſts lay much ſtreſſe upon this that the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:41280:185"/>Evangeliſts and Saint Paul do of one common accord write that <hi>the ſame night</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>was delivered to the Jewes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.24.</note> 
                     <hi>he tooke bread, bleſſed it, brooke it, and gave it.</hi> They inſiſte much u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this breaking of the bread, which according to them repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents that the Boby of our Lord was broken for us upon the Croſſe, and remarke with great care that Saint Paul, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid that JESUS <hi>broke bread,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.24.</note> makes him ſay according to the Greeke text, <hi>This is my Body broken for you;</hi> to shew, as they pretend, the reference this Bread broken has to the Body immolated. So that this breaking appeares to them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the myſtery; and this is it which makes thoſe of Heidelberg ſay in their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme much eſteemed by thoſe of their party,
<note place="margin">Catech. Heid. qu. 75.</note> 
                     <hi>that as truly as
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41280:185"/>they ſee the bread of the Supper broken to be given to them, ſo truly has</hi> JESUS-CHRIST <hi>been offered and broken for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a propoſall made for an accord or union with the Lutherans,
<note place="margin">Colloq. Caſſel an. 1661.</note> and a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was held for this about twenty yeares ſince, that is in the yeare 1661. The Calviniſts of Marpourg hereupon found quickly a diſtinction, and in the declaration which they gave to the Lutherans of Rintell, they ſaid, that <hi>the breaking appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to the eſſenſe but only to the integrity of the Sacrament, as beeing neceſſary becauſe of the example and command of</hi> JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS-CHRIST: <hi>ſo that the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans ceaſed not to have, without this breaking of the Bread, the ſubſtance of the Supper, and thus they might mutually tolerate one another.</hi> The Calviniſts have not
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:41280:186"/>beene, that I know of, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by any of theirs, and the union which was made had on their ſide its entire effect: in ſo much that they cannot hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſiſt upon the words of the inſtitution ſeing one may by their own acknowledgement haye the ſubſtance of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per without entirely ſubjecting himſelfe to the inſtitution, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample and expreſſe command of our Lord. What would they ſay if we should make uſe of ſuch an anſwer? But as all is permitted to the Lutherans ſo all is inſupportable amongſt Catholicks.</p>
                  <p>The other objections carry no greater weight and are as eaſily ſolved.</p>
                  <p>The concomitancy upon which the Roman Church grounds Communion under one ſpecies is not (ſay you)
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:41280:186"/>found in antiquity. Firſt what I have drawn from the antient Church to eſtablish this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is matter of fact; and if Communion under one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſuppoſe concomitancy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the reality, it followes from thence that both the one and the other were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in antiquity where Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under one kind was ſo frequent. Secondly, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, open your own bookes, open Aubertin the moſt learneſt defendor of your doctrine:
<note place="margin">Aub. lib. III. p. 431. 485. 505. 539. 570. &amp;c.</note> you will finde there in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry page paſſages taken from Saint Ambroſe,

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:41280:187"/>hands: they received JESUS-CHRIST and the Word of God; they received his Flesh as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; not as the flesh of a meere man, but as the Flesh of a God. Is not this to receive the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity togeather with the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Son of God, and in a word his entire perſon? After this what would you call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe precautions uſed leaſt the Euchariſt should be let fall upon the ground, there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des only a little fincerity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they are as antient as the Church her ſelfe.

If this unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable buffoon had remarked in the antient Fathers with what decency and reſpect they approched to the Euchariſt; if he would have regarded in Saint Cyrill after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the faithfull at this time taſted the ſacred Cupp,
<note place="margin">Cyr. Hier. Gat. 5. myſt.</note> and how they were ſo far from ſuffering one drop of it to be loſt that with reſpect they tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that moiſtneſſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained upon their lipps to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:41280:189"/>applye it to their eyes, and the other organs of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which they believed to be ſanctified thereby: hee would have found it a thing more worthy himſelfe to have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly ſet forth this act of piety, than to make his party laugh by the ridiculous deſcription wee have now heard. But theſe ſeof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers may do their worſt, their railleries can do no more injury to the Euchariſt, then thoſe of others did to the Trinity, and to the Incarnation of the Son of God; and the majeſty of theſe myſteryes cannot be debaſed by ſuch diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>M. Jurieux reprefents us as men who feare leaſt there should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>ſome offenſive accident to the Body and Blood of our Lord. I do not perceive</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that he is better placed upon a white cloth then in the duſt;</hi> and ſeeing wee
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:41280:190"/>can behold him <hi>without horrour</hi> in the mouth and ſtomack, wee ought not to be aſtonished <hi>to ſee him upon the pavement.</hi> In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſpeake humanly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh, the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is perhaps a place as much or more proper then our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks; and to ſpeake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to faith, the glorious ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of JESUS CHRIST at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dos equally elevate him above all: but reſpect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will have it, that as far as lyes in us, wee should pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce him, where himſelfe would be. It is man that he ſeekes, and he is ſo far from having on abhorrance from our flesh, ſeing he created it, ſeing he redeemed it, ſeing he vallues it, that he willingly approches to ſanctify it. What ever has a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this uſe, honours him, becauſe it has a dependance
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:41280:190"/>upon that glorious quality of Saviour of man kinde. Wee do, as much as lyes in us, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to hinder whatever may derogate from the veneration due to the Body and Blood of our Maſter; and without fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>any accident</hi> should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>prejudiciall to</hi> JESUS-CHRIST, wee avoid what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might shew in us the leaſt want of reſpect. But if our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions cannot prevent all, wee know that JESUS-CHRIST, who is ſufficiently guarded by his own Majeſty, is contented with our zeale, and cannot be debaſed by any place. A man may railly if he will at this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: but wee are ſo far from blushing at it, that wee blush for thoſe who do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thoſe railleries they make uſe of againſt our precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reflect upon the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:41280:191"/>no leſſe cautious then wee. If it was fitting to augment them theſe later ages, it is not that the Euchariſt hath been more honoured then in the firſt; but raither that piety being rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed it was neceſſary it should be excited by more efficacious meanes: in ſuch ſort that theſe new and needfull precautions; in denoting our reſpects, make it appeare there has been ſome negligence in our conduct.</p>
                  <p>For my ſelfe, I eaſily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve that amidſt the order, the ſilence, the gravity of antient Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblyes, it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never arrived, that the Blood of our Lord was ſpilt: it was only in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and confuſion of theſe laſt ages, that theſe ſcandals frequently arriving cauſed the people to deſire to receive that ſpecies only which they ſaw
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:41280:191"/>leſſe expoſed to the like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; ſo much the rather becauſe in receiving it alone, they knew they loſt nothing, ſeing they poſſeſſed him whole and entire who was the ſole object of their love.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe I will not deny but that after Berengarius had rejected, (in deſpite of the Church of his time and the Tradition of all the Fathers) the reall preſence of JESUS-CHRIST in this Sacrament, the beliefe of this myſtery was (as I may ſay) enlivened or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated, and that the piety of the faithfull, offended by this hereſy, ſought how to ſignalize it ſelfe by new teſtimonyes. I acknowledge in this the ſpirit of the Church, which did not adore JESUS-CHRIST nor the Holy Ghoſt with ſuch il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious teſtimonyes til after
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:41280:192"/>hereticks had denyed their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. The miſtery of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt ought to be in equall proportion with the reſt, and Berengarius his hereſy muſt not ſerve the Church leſſe then that of Arius and Macedonius.</p>

                  <p>But can they show us the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke adoration rendred to the water of Baptiſme?

Theſe Paſſages of the Antients are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and till ſuch times as our Reformers have comprehended them ſo far as to be convinced of it, they will at leaſt ſee this inferiour worship, upon which
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41280:193"/>they make ſo many cavills; they will ſee a worship diſtinguished from the ſupreme worship; yet nevertheleſſe a religious one, ſeing it makes a part of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſervice, and of the reception thus of the Holy Sacraments. By juſtifying themſelves ſo ſo concerning the Euchariſt, they take from themſelves all wayes or meanes of accuſing us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Reliques, Images, and the veneration of Saints. So true it is that their Church and Religion reſſembles a ruinous ſtructure, which cannot, as I may ſay, be covered on one ſide, without beeing expoſed on the other, and can never exhibit that perfect integrity, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parts which compoſe the beauty and ſolidity of a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
